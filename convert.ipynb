      "   THE ALCORAN OF MAHOMET.  CHAP. I. The Chapter of the Preface, containing seven Verses, written at Mecca. IN the Name of God, gracious and merciful; Praised be God, gracious and merciful: King of the Day of Judgement. It is thee whom we adore; it is from thee we require help. Gu^de us in the right way, in the way of them that thou hast gratified; against whom thou hast not been displeased, and we shall not be mis-led.   CHAP. II. The Chapter of the Cow* con^aining ^wo hundred fou^scor^ and seven Verses, written at Mecca. IN the Name of God, gracious and merciful.See Erpennius his Grammar. I am the most wise God. There is no Error in th^s Book; it guideth into the right w^y, those that-are r^ghteous, who believe what they see not, who make their P^ayers with affection, and dispence in Alms, a part of the Goods that we have given them. Such as believe the things that are inspired into thee, in those that have been Preached before thee,  and at the end of the world are not ignorant they are guided by their Lord, and shall be blessed. Misery is upon unbelievers. Whether thou reprove them, or do not reprove them, they will not be converted, God hath shut up their heart, their ears and eyes, and they shall suffer great torments.See the Explication of Gelaldin. Many men say, we believe in God, and the Day of Judgement, and do not believe; they think to deceive God, and them that believe in God; certainly they deceive themselves, and know it not. God will augment the infirmity which they have in their heart, and they shall undergo the rigors of an infinite pain, by reason of their lying. When it was said to them; Pollute not the earth, they said, We are true observers of the Law of God; notwithstanding, they were they that polluted the earth, but they knew it not. When it was said to them, Belieue ye as the world believeth? They said, Shall we believe as fools believe?See Gelaldin. they themselves are fools, and know it not. When they met with such as believe in God, they said, we believe as you do: And when they returned towards the devils, their companions, they said, We believe as you, and mock at those men: Certainly God mocketh them, and continueth them in their Errors, to their confusion. They that have purchased Error, for the right way, have gained nothing in their commerce, and are not well directed; they are like to such as kindled fire, and when it hath enlightened what is about them, God hath deprived them of light, and left them in darkness, deaf, dumb, blind, and they shall never be converted; or as a cloud of Heaven, full of darkness thunder, and lightning, they stopt their ears with their fingers, by reason of the noise, and for fear of death; but God seeth the unbelievers, he caused lightning to approach, that ravished from them their sight; they have followed what appeared to them, and are detained in darkness: But if God had pleased, he had deprived them, both of hearing, and sight; for he is omnipotent. O People! worship your Lord, who created you, and all that were before you; it may be, That you will fear him that hath extended the Earth, that raised the Heaven, and caused Rain to descend; that caused the production of Fruits to enrich  you. Say not, that God hath a companion equal to him, because you know the conttary. If you doubt that I have sent my servant, come, and bring some Chapters like to the Alcoran, and call to witness the Idols that you adore; if you are good men, if you have not done it, or cannot perform it, Fear the fire of Hell prepared for Infid^ls, and Idolaters; and declare to true believers, who do good works, That they shall enjoy the immense pleasures of Paradise, wherein flow many Rivers; they shall there finde all sorts of faire and savory Fruits, which God hath prepared for them; they shall consider, if they be like to such as they had before in the world: They shall there have wives, fair, and delicate, and shal dwel in eternall felicity. God is not ashamed to compare a little The Puny is a stinking worm, frequently growing in Beds in hot Countries. Puny to an extream Greatness: Now, so it is, that true believers know, that it proceedeth from their Lord. The wicked demand, what God doth mean by that comparison? He by this means mis-leadeth, and directeth many men; but mis-leadeth none, but the disobedient. Such as pervert his Testament, and his Promises; such as retrench his Commandements, and defile the Earth, are damned. Why will you be impious, seeing that God hath given you life after death? He will cause you to dye, he will raise you again, and you shall all return before him to be judged. He it is, that created whatever is upon Earth, and ascended to Heaven, hath ordained seven Heavens, knowing all things. Remember to instruct men,See Kitab el tenoir. that thy Lord said to his Angels, I would create a Vicar upon Earth; and when they answered, Wilt thou there place him that shall defile it, and shed blood, while we exalt thy Glory, and sanctifie thee; I know said he, what you know not. He taught Ad^^ the names of all things, who discovered them to the Angels, to whom God said, Declare to me the names of all things that I have created, if you know them; they replyed, Praise is due to thy Divine Majesty, we know nothing but what thou hast taught us, thou alone art knowing and wise. He said to Adam, Declare to them the names of all things that I have created. After he had taught them, God said, Did I not tell you, that I knew what is not,  neither in Earth, nor Heaven; and that I understand whatever you make manifest, and whatever you keep most secret? Remember thou, that we said to the Angels, Humble your selves before Adam; they all humbled themselves, except the Devil: He was already proud, and in the number of the wicked. We said unto Adam, Dwell thou and thy wife in Paradise, and eat there what thou likest, but approach not that Tree, lest thou be in the number of the unjust. The Devil made them to sin, and depart from the Grace in which they were; then we said to them, Descend you enemies one to another, you shall have a dwelling upon Earth, and goods wherewith to live for a time. Adam begged pardon for his fault of his Lord, he pardoned him, because he is gracious and mercifull, and said, Descend, and go all of you out of Paradise; there shall hereafter come to you, a guide from me. Such as shall follow him, shall be delivered from fear and affl^ction (at the day of Judgement;) such as shall be impious, and conceal my Commandements,The Alcoran in the old and new Testament. shall burn eternally in the fire of Hell. O children of Is^a^l, remember the Grace I have done you, I will satisfie my Promises, perform yours, fear me, and believe in what I have sent from Heaven, confirming what was before taught you; be not the first impious, and forsake not my Law at any rate; fear me, and cover not the Truth with a lye, neither willingly conceal it: Make your prayers at the time appointed, pay Tithes, and worship your Lord with them that adore him. Will you command people that have no care of their souls, to do good? Will you meditate upon Scripture, without observing it? Entreat for succor with patience, and with prayers they abound not, but in them th^t are obedient, that believe they shall one day behold their Lord, and shall return before him to be judged. O children of ^sra^l, call to mind my favours. I have preferred you to all the world; fear the day, wherein one Soul shall not be chastised for another; when prayer shall not be heard, neither ransom succors nor prot^ct^on to be found for the wicked. Remember, that we delivered you from the hands of Phar^oh, who affl^cted you through the violence of torments, who  murthered your children, abused your wives; and that your Lord encreased your miseries, because of the enormity of your crimes. Remember, that we divided the Seas to save you, and that we drowned Pharaohs men in your view; neverthelesse, you worshipped the Calf, when we detained Moses with us forty nights, in which you were extreamly too blame; after this, we pardoned you, it may be that you will give me thanks. We gave unto Moses the Book, that distinguisheth good from evill; perhaps you will be converted. Remember, that Moses said to his people,Gelaldin saith, the innocent slay the wicked. You were too blame for having adored the Calf; repent, and be converted to your Creator: Slay one another, that wil be a thing acceptable to God; he will pardon your crime, he is gracious and mercifull. You said, O Moses, we will not believe thee, for that we see not God; then you were smitten with thunder,We have pardoned you: See Gelaldin. you saw your misery with your own eyes: nevethelesse, we raised you after your death; perhaps you will give me thanks. We covered you with the shadow of clouds, we caused Manna and Quails to fall upon you, and said, Eat the good things we have given you. They did us no harm, when they murmured; they afflicted themselves. We said, Enter into that City,Gelaldin saith, it is Jerusalem See Kitab el tenoir. and eat therein what shall content you; enter in at the gate, with humility, and say, Remove our sins from us. I will pardon your offences, and encrease the Graces of those that are righteous: then the wicked altered their words that were taught them; but I sent my indignation from Heaven upon them, according to their demerits. When Moses demanded drink for his people, we said, Smite the Rock with thy Rod, incontinently there sprung forth twelve Fountains, and every man knew his place, where to drink: Eat, and drink the good things of God, and defile not the Earth any more. You said unto Moses, we are not satisfied with one sort of meat; entreat thy Lord that he give us what the Earth produceth, Beets, Cucumbers, Garlick, Lentils, and Onions; he said, Desire you to change good for evil? Go down into Egypt, you will there find what you require. They were beaten with disgrace, and poverty, and returned into the wrath of God,  for that they disobeyed his Commandements, and unjustly slew his Prophets, for which they were greatly to blame. All those that shall believe Christians, Jews or Samaritans, such as shall believe in God, at the day of Judgement, and doe good work^s, shall be recompensed by their Lord,See Gelaldin. and be free from feare, and affl^ction, at the day of the Resurrection, When we received your promise, to believe in the Old T^stament, we ra^sed a mountaine over you, to over-shadow you, and sa^d, Comprehend with affection, what we teach you, and remember; perhaps you will feare the fire of Hell, and disobedience; neverthelesse, you have gone astray, without the mercy of your Lord you shall be in the number of the damned. You know what befell those that observed not the Sabboth; we said unto them, Be ye abhorred, and despised as Apes;See Kitab el tenoir. We left this punishment, as an advertisement to their temporaries and posterity, and particularly, to be for an example to the true beleevers. Remember thou, that Moses said unto the people, God commandeth you to sacrifice a Cow. They answered, doest thou mock us? He replied, God defend me from being in the number of the ignorant; they said, Call upon thy Lord, that he instruct us what Cow that ought to be; he said, it must be a Cow of a middle age, neither young, nor old, and doe what is commanded you; They said, pray unto thy Lord, that he shew us of what colour it ought to be. It must, said he, be of a bright, yellow colour, that it may delight the eyes of the beholders. They said, Invoke thy Lord, that he instruct us, what it ought to resemble, and we shall (if it please him) be obedient to his Commandements; He said, God answereth you, that it must be a Cow, that never bare the yoke, to till the earth, neither water the fields, round, and that hath never laboured, neither hath spot upon her body. They said, thou hast now spoken truth; they then sacrificed her, and it wanted not much, but they had not done it: When you have slaine any one, you are then full of wrath, and become proud; God bringeth to light whatever you conceale; We ^aid, smite that dead body with a piece of that Cow: so  God raiseth againe the dead,The Turks believe that a man shall rise again, being smitten with the tongue of that Cow. and manifesteth to you his miracles; it may be you will comprehend them, yet your hearts are hardned, more obdurate then Rocks; for Rivers flow from Rocks, when they cleave and appeare, or when they fall and overturne by the permission of his divine Majesty. God is not ignorant of your actions. Do you desire the Jews should beleeve you, because many among them write the word of God, and alter it at pleasure, after they have comprized it? When they meet with true beleevers, they say, we beleeve in God, and being assembled, they say among themselves,See Bedaci. have you entertained those true beleevers, for that God hath instructed you, that they may find no excuse against you at the day of Judgement, before his divine Majesty?See Gelaldin. Understand you not that they would excuse themselves upon what you have said to them? Know they not that God knoweth whatever they conceale, and what they bring to light? There be some that know neither to read nor write, that understand nothing of Scripture, but what they have learned from the lies of their Doctors, yet they thinke to be knowing men. Miseries is upon them that conceale the Scripture in their hands, that alter it, and say, that what they read proceedeth from God to profit any thing thereby. Misery is upon them, because of what their hands have written; misery is upon them, and upon what they have gained, in blaspheming against God. They have said, we shall continue in Fire but a certaine number of dayes: Say unto them, have you capitulated with God? He will not act against his promises: Will you speak of God what you know not? Such as have gained ought, and were entangled in the sinne of their gaine, shall for ever remaine in the flames of Hell; and they that have faith in God, and doe good works, shall eternally enjoy the delights of Paradise. Remember thou, that we taught the Commandements of the Law, and how we said to the children of Israel, worship one only God, doe good unto your father and mother, to your allies, orphans and the poore: speak mildely unto the people, make your prayers at the time appointed, and pay your Tithes;  ^^verthelesse they were disobedient, except some ver^ few am^^g them. When we received the Commandment of God, and that we said, shed not your blood, neither fo^sake your houses, you approved it, your selves are w^tne^ses; Neverthelesse you slew many, and constrained a grea^ number to desert their habitation, you assisted each othe^ in injustice, and impiety. If slaves have recourse to you you shall redeeme them, their deliverance is appointe^ you: Do you beleeve one part of the Scripture to abjun^ the other? The reward of any of you that shal do this thin^ is ignominie in this world, and to be precipitated into th^ most grievous torments of H^ll at the day of judgement God is not ignorant of your actions. Such as purchase th^ life of the world, to quit Paradise, shal not be eased in thei^ miseries and be utterly deprived of succours. Certainly, we gave the Law to Moses and after him sent many Prophets; We inspired knowledg into Jesus the son of M^r^* and strengthned him by the Holy Ghost, but you arose against the Prophets that came contrary to your affections, you belyed on^ part, and slew another. The unbeleevers said, our heart i^ hardned; It is God that hath cursed them, by reason o^ their impiety, and few of them will beleeve the Commandements of his divine Majesty. When God hath sent them any Book, confirming the Scriptures, which they before approved (viz. the Old Testament, and the Gospell) they demanded succours when they meet with the wicked, and being succoured, they either understood it not, or would not receive it. The curse of God is upon Infidels, especially upon them that have sold their souls, and through envie disobeyed his Commandements: He bestoweth his grace on whom he pleaseth, they are returned in the displeasure of his Divine Majesty, who hath prepared for them grievous torments, because of the enormity of their crimes. When it was said to them, Believe in the Commandements of God;See Kitab el tenoir. they said, Doe we not believe in what hath beene commanded us? Neverthelesse they have no faith in the truth which God hath sent, confirming the Prophecies, and the precepts that they before approved; Say unto them, had you heretofore  slain the Prophets, if you had believed in his Law? Moses certainly had caused you to see Miracles; but ye adored the Calf after his departure, wherfore you were greatly too blame. We received your promise, to observe the Commandements of the Law, and raised aThe Turks believe that God raised a Mountain over the Israelites, to overshadow them. Mountain over you; Understand with affection what we teach you, and hearken what is commanded you; they answered, we have heard, and disobeyed, and inclined their heart to the adoration of the Calf, because of their impietie. Say to them, doth your faith command you to doe it, if you believe in God, and life eternal? T^^nk upon death, if you be righteous; They regard not their past errors, but God knoweth the unjust: Thou shalt find them with diligence, and desire to live a long time; The wicked hope to live a thousand years; but they shal be exempt from the punishment to live long; God beholdeth all their actions. Say to them, who is an enemy to Gabr^^^? He by the permission of God hath inspired into Maho, met. thee the Alcoran, that confirmeth the ancient Scriptures, and guideth the good in the way of their Salvation, and declareth to them the joyes of Paradise. He that is an enemy to God, the Angels, his Prophet to Gabriel and Michael, shal be rigorously chastised, God is an enemy to Infidels. We have sent thee precepts, cleare, and intelligible, none will abjure them but the wicked: Some of them have acted against their own promises, and the greatest part is incredulous; many of them that have knowledge in the written law, have forsaken it, even when God sent them any Prophet to confirm the Scriptures, that they had before received, and approved: They cast the book of God behind their backs, as if they knew it not, and adhered to what the Devils taught in the raign of Solomon, (yet Solomon sinned not, but the Devils only, that instructed the people in Magick) and what was taught by the two Angels,Arot and Marot Magicians. Arot and Marot in Babylon. Before they taught the people, they said, We are not sedition, ne^ther be you impious. The people learnd of them, what concerneth the separation of the man and the woman, and what breedeth hatred betwixt them. They did not harm to any by their Magick; but through the permission of go^, the people learned of them what might hurt,  and not to be profitable to them; they instructed in Magick them that sold their part in Paradise, at the losse (...) their souls, although they knew their error, that they ha^ before beleeved in God, and feared his divine Majesty Repentance inspired by God is exceeding profitable, they understood to know it. O you that feare God, say not honour us; say, regard us, and hearken to what is commanded you. To Infidels are prepared dolorous torments the Jews and Christians desired not that God should sen^ you good, but God very liberall, gratifieth with his mercy whom he pleaseth: he will not alter his Commandements, neither forget them; he will moreover teach other^ more profitable, or of the like nature; know you not tha^ God is omnipotent? understand you not that to God appertains the Kingdom of heaven, and of earth; who excep^ God will be your protector? Will you question your Prophet, as Moses was heretofore questioned? He that shal^ change faith into impiety,The Jews and Christians who have the written Law. shall forsake the good way. Many that have knowledge in the Scripture, endeavoured t^ mislead you through impiety and envy, notwithstanding they are not ignorant of the Truth; forgive them, and beware of them, untill God hath (otherwise) disposed, he i^ Omnipotent.See Gelaldin. Make your prayers at the time appointed, and pay your Tithes, you shal find before God the good that you do for your souls; he beholdeth all your actions. They have said that none but the Jews and Christians shall enter into Paradise, it is their fals invention; say unto them, if you be good men, bring your Reasons on the contrary, he that resigneth himself to God, and is a just man, shall be recompensed by his divine Majesty, there needeth not be any fear for him, he shal not be tormented in the fire of hel. The Jews say, the Christians are void of reason; and the Christians affirm the Jews to be without reason, neverthelesse they study the Scripture, so speak the ignorant, God will determine their difference at the day of the Resurrection. Who is more unjust, then he that hindred, that God be remembred in Temples, and that studieth nought but their destruction? such men cannot enter therein, but with fear and terrour; they shall have on earth shame upon the  ^orehead, and, in the other world, shall suffer exceeding ^reat torments. The East and West are Gods, whither so^ver men turn themselves, the face of God doth there meet ^^em, his Divinity extendeth through the whole earth. They said, beleeve you that God hath a Son? Praised be God on the contrary; whatever is either in earth or hea^en, appertaineth to his Divine Majesty, and all things o^ey him; he hath created heaven and earth, and when he ^illeth any thing, he saith, Be thou, and it is. The unbe^eevers sa^d, if God speak not to us, or if thou performest ^o miracls, we wil not beleeve thee; their predecessors have ^aid as much, and their words have been like unto their ^earts; we have caused miracles to appear to the righteous, ^nd have sent thee to preach and instruct the people; in^uire not why those that shal descend into hell wil not be^ieve thee; the Jews and Christians will not be satisfied of ^hee, until thou follow their opinion; say unto them, there is ^o better guide in the world then God; take heed lest thou ^ollow their appetites, after that thou hast comprehended ^he knowledge which we inspired into thee, who except God, will be thy defendor? They whom we have taught the Scripture, that study and read it with truth, beleeve the con^ents of it; and they that do not beleeve, are damned. O chil^ren of Israel call to mind the favour that I did you; I pre^erred you before all the world, fear the day wherein one ^oul shall not be able to assist another, when a ransom shal not be accepted, neither excuse; and when the wicked shal not be protected. Remember thou, that Abraham requested of the Lord an accomplishment of his Word; he said to him, I will establish thee among the people, to teach them the mysteries of my Law: and he said, what shal become of my ^^nage? He answered, Paradise shal not be open to the unjust. We have established the Temple of Mecca for a sure refuge of the people, in repentance; he made his Oratorie ^t Abrahams Abrahams place is an Oratory in the temple of Mecca. place; and we have commanded Abraham and Ismael to keep clean my house for them that shall repair thither in procession, with humility and adoration. When Abraham received this command, he said, Lord fortifie this City, and enrich its people with all good things, and all the inhabitants thereof, that shal believe in thy divine  Majesty, and the day of judgment. God said, I wil^ for a time enrich the Infidels also, and precipitate them i^ to the fire of hell, where they shall remain to all eternit^ When Abraham and Ismael raised the foundations of th^ Temple of Mecca, A^raham said, Lord accept our vows; cho^ understandest all, and knowest all things: Lord give us th^ grace to be obedient to thy Commandments, and let a pe^ple issue from our loyns that may observe thy Law: Shew t^ the way we ought to follow, and have mercy upon us; tho^ art gracious and mercifull: Lord send to this thy people Prophet of their nation, to preach to them thy Co^mand^ments, to instruct them in Scripture and knowledge, an^ to purifie them, thou art omnipotent and wise.

Say unt^ them, wil you dispute with us concerning God, who is you^  and our Lord? We will answer with our action, and you shall answer with yours; all our confidence is in his D^vine pleasure: Will you say, that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, were Iews or Christians? Are you m^re knowing then God? Who is more unjust, then he that concealeth the miracles that he hath seen to proceed from God? He is not ignorant of all your actions. The good that those men have done, remaine to them; and the evill that they shall commit, shall be against you: enquire not after what they did. Some ignorant among the people will say, Their Prophet doth not appoint them to turn the face to that side, to which they turned heretofore, when they made their O^isons. Say unto them, The East and W^st belong unto God; he directeth in the right way whom he pleaseth. As we have conducted you into the right way; we have likewise commanded you to doe that which is just; that you be witnesses against the people at the day of judgement,See Gelaldin. and the Prophet witnesse against you. I have not ordained, that you turne your face as heretofore, when you made your Orisons, to the end, they may be knowne that follow the Prophet, from them that returne to their impiety.

Your God, is one ^ God; there is none other God, but God gracious and ^^^cifull. The Creation of the Heavens, and the Earth, difference of the day and the night, the Ship that sai^  on the Sea for the advantage of commerce, the Rain that falleth from Heaven, to give life to the Earth after its death, the diversity of Winds, and the Clouds that move between Heaven and Earth, are signes of the unity of God, to those that can understand it. There be, that adore Idols, and love them; The True-believers love but one sole God. When thou shalt see the wicked, know they shall one day see the punishment of other crimes. All strength and vertue proceedeth from God, most severe in his chastisements. When that a part of them that had embraced the true Law, separated themselves from the company of True believers, and that any mischief befell them, they could not reunite themselves: Then they said, in their affliction, If we another time meet our companions, we will separate our selves from them, as they have separated themselves from us: Thus shall God give them to understand their error,See Kitab ^l. tenoir. with exceeding sorrow, and they shall be eternally confined in the fire of Hell. O ye people! eat what is good and savory in the Earth, and follow not the steps of the Divell; he is your open enemy, he will command you that which is evill, and filthy; and to speak of God what you know not. When it was said to the Infidels, obey the Commandements of God, they said. We will follow the steps of our Fathers; we will observe, what they observed: surely their Fathers were unwise, and mis^led; they are like to him that cryeth, and understandeth nothing of what is spoken, but the voyce; they are deaf, dumb, blind, and without judgement. O ye, that believe in God, eat the good things that hee hath given you, and give him thanks, if it bee him that you worship. Hee forbiddeth you to eate Carrion, Blood, Swines flesh, and whatever is not killed, in pronouncing the name of his Divine Majesty, except it bee in extreame necessity; and in this case, it shall not bee reputed disobedience, nor sin; God is benigne, and mercifull: what they eata, that conceale the Word of God, for any profit or advantage, shall be nothing but matter of fire in their bowels. God shall not speak to them at the day of judgement, but with fury; he will not purifie them, and they shall suffer  rigorous torments. They that have purchased error fo^ the right way, and punishment for pardon, shall burn ^^ the fire of Hell; for that God hath sent the most true Boo^ that containeth his Commandements; they that impugn^ what is contained in that Book, are in an exceeding grea^ error, far from the truth. It is not justification to turn the face, making your prayers towards the East or West; h^ shall be justified, that shall believe in God, the day o^ judgement, the Angels, the Scriptures, and the Prophets and that in charity shall impart some part of his goods te^ his parents, to orphans, to the poore, to pilgrims, and t^ slaves. Such as believe in God, and have his feare befor^ their eyes, persevere in their prayers, pay Tithes; they satisfie their promises, and are patient in their adversities, O^ ye that believe! the Talio is co^manded you in murther* the free for the free, the slave for the slave, the woman fo^ the woman. But if any one pardon the blood of his brother, he shall prosecute the malefactor, according to wha^ he shall see ^ost advantagious, through damages and interests: It is a facility wh^ch God hath given you, through his mercy. He that shall doe injury to the malefactor, having received satisfaction of him shall suffer grievous torments; at the day of judgement you shall find life in the Talio.The Talio is a pain equall to the offence O you that are w^se! it may be you will feare God: He commandeth you to make your Testament, when you approach unto death; give legacies of your substance to you^ Father, and Mother, your neer K^n^ed, and bestow Alms on the poore. If any man alter your Testament, the sin shall be upon him, and upon all them that shall alter it: God understandeth, and knoweth all things: If any one fe^reth that there is an error in the Testament, that opposeth Reason, he shall doe well to reconcile the parties w^th affection, God is gracious and bountifull. O ye that bel^eve! Fasting is commanded you, as it was them that were before you; you shall feare God, and Fast, particularly, a certaine number of days: but if any one among you is sick, or in travell, at the time of Fasting, he shall count the days that he fasted not, and shall fulfill them at another time. Such as are not of strength to Fast, shall  ^^tisfie for Fasting, through Alms; he that shall obey, shall doe well; If you Fast, you shall doe well. Fast the month of Ramazan is their Faster, which continueth 30 daies; during which, the Fast. Ramazan, in which the Alcoran descended from Heaven, to guide men into the right way; it containeth pre^epts of Divine Right, and distinguish good from evill, all ^hose that live to this month, ought to Fast. He that is ^ick, or in a voyage, shall accomplish the days that he fa^ted not another time, at his conveniency: God willeth ^hat his Law should be light unto you, and not a burthen; ^is will is, that you observe the dayes of fasting, and that ^ou returne him thanks, for that he hath guided you in the ^ight way, perhaps you will give him thanks; I will be near ^nto my servants, when they shall enquire of thee concerning the mysteries of my Law; I will heare their Suppli^ations when they invoke me,See Gelaldin. that they may persevere in ^bedience to my Commandements; peradventure they will ^llow the right way. It is lawfull for you to know your ^ives the night of fasting, they are necessary to you, as ^our cloathes, and you are to them as necessary as their ^arments: God knoweth, that otherwise you should have ^trayed your soules; he is bountifull to you, and hath par^oned you, know them, and performe what God hath ap^ointed you. Eate and drinke, untill you may distinguish white thre^d from a black by the light of the morning, ^en begin to fast untill night; Know not your wives when ^ou are in the Temple: Such are the limits prescribed of ^od, transgresse them not: So God manifesteth his Com^^ndement to the people, perhaps they will have the fea^e (...) his divine Majestie before their eyes. Dispend not your ^oods unprofitable, and with vanitie, and corrupt not the ^udges with gifts, and presents, to eate maliciously the sub^^ance of another, they will question you concerning the ^ew Moone; say yee, That it is the signe of the time ap^ointed for pilgrimages; It is not reasonable that you ^ould enter the house of another a back way, he that ^ares God, doth well to enter through the gate. Feare ^od, and you shall be happie; fight for his Law against ^em that assault you, and doe wrong to no man, he loveth ^at them that are unjust; flie Infidels wheresoever you find  them, and expell them out of the place, from which th^^ shall have driven you; Sedition is worse then murther fight not against them at Mecca, untill they assault you; they there fight you, kill them, such is the punishment (...) Infidels: if they set a period to their infidelity, God wi^^ be to them gracious and mercifull: Fight against them t^ avoid sedition: Faith proceedeth from God: If they des^^ from their impiety, you shall exercise no hostility again^^ them, but only against the wicked: If they fight you in th^ month of Mharam, you shall fight them also in that sa^^ month, and observe a reciprocation in honours. Offe^ them that shall offend you in that month, in the same ma^ner that they shall have offended you. Feare God, a^ know that he is with them that feare him, dispend for (...) glorie, and throw not your selves into your owne destruc^^on; doe good, he loveth those that doe good, accompli^^ the Pilgrimage appointed, if you be not hindred by yo^ enemies, or have not conveniencie to performe it; Sha^ not your heads, untill you arrive at the place appoint for Sacrifices; if any of you be diseased, or sick in the he^ he shall there give satisfaction by fasting, almes, and S^crifices, when you shall be in a place of safetie, and se^^ from your enemies. Such as shall be hindred to accompl^^^ Pilgrimage, and such as have not meanes to satisfie for (...) sacrifices ordained, shall fast three daies, during the ti^^ of Pilgrimage, and seven daies at their returne, which in all ten daies,See the explication of Chasai. if they be not inhabitants at Mecca, w^^ their wives and Families. Feare God, and know, that h^ severe in his punishments; Pilgrimage ought to be per^^^med in a certaine month, they that shall desire to perfo^^ it, at the time prescribed, shall not know their wives, t^ shall be humble, and shall have no quarrell in that voya^^ God knoweth all your good actions, he shall augment y^ faculties,Beda^i faith, passe where Ad^m an^ Ab^^^am p^ssed. he is a great rewarder. O you that are wise, f^^ me, you sinne not in demanding good from your Lord, making merchandize in that voyage. When you shall part from the Mountaine of Arefat, remember God in of Mouchar, remember how he hath guided you, and how were before out of the way; passe through where that ^ple  were wont to passe, and implore pardon? of God, he is gracious and mercifull. Having finished your Orisons, remember God with affection, as your Fathers remembred you; There be among the people, that say, Lord give us good in this world, and have no part in the other. Others there be, that say, Lord bestow on us the good of this world, Paradise in the other, and deliver us from the fire of Hell; They shall all find the good and the evill that they have done, God is exact to keep account He that shall advance his voyage two dayes, shall not sinne, neither he that shall retard it, if he feare God, Feare God, and know, that you shall all one day appeare before his Divine Majestie to be judged. There be men whose speech will be pleasing to thee in this world, they will call God to witnesse what is in their hearts, neverthelesse they are very pernicious, when removed from thee, and travelling upon the earth, they there commit filthinesse, and ruine both Village and fruits. God loveth not disorders; When it was said to them, feare God, pride, with sin, possessed them, but Hell shall be their habitation. Some there be among the people, that sell their owne persons, out of a great desire to please God, surely he is gracious to them that serve him. O yee that believe in God! be obedient to his Commandents, and pursue not the steps of the Devill, he is your open enemie; if you sin against God, having once learned his Commandements, know, that he is omnipotent to chastise you, and prudent in all his workes. Will the wicked expect that God should appeare to them in the obscuritie of a Cloud? Or else the Angels with Command to extirpate them, they shall be assembled before his Divine Majestie to be judged. Demand of the Children of Israel, how many Miracles were made appear to them? He that altereth the grace he shall have received of God, shall be severely punished. The wicked esteeme the life of the world, and scorne those that believe in God; but such as believe God, shall be above them at the day of Iudgement; he enricheth with innumerable good things whom he pleaseth. The world was all of one Religion,See Kitab el tenoir. before impietie tooke place: God sent his Prophets to instruct the people, to shew them their errour, and declare  to them the joyes of Paradise; he sent with them, the book of truth, to judge the differences among men, no man contradicted the Contents of it, but The Iews and Christians. such as had knowledge of the Scripture, and this caused the envie that is risen among them; God guided them that observed his Commandements, and such, as with his permission, obeyed his will, he directeth in the right way,See Gelaldin. whom it pleaseth him. Doe yee believe to enter Paradise, unlesse that happen to you, that befell your Predecessors? They were touched with miseries, and diseases, and trembled untill that very instant that the Prophet said to the true believers that were with him; When shall divine succour come? Notwithstanding Divine succour was not farre off; They shall question thee concerning what they ought to expend; Say unto them, you shall assist with your goods, your father and mother, your allies, Orphans, the poore, and pilgrims. God will understand all the good you shall doe; Fighting is enjoyned you, although it bee against your will; it may chance that you will shunne that which is profitable to you, and likewise love what is pernicious to you, God knoweth what you know not. They shall aske of thee, if they shall fight in the month of Mharam; say unto them, great battels shalt happen in this month, that shall shut up to the people the way of the Law of God; and impie^ies, that shall hinder the multitude to goe to Mecca. To drive the people from Mecca is an exceeding great sinne: Sedition is worse then murther; The wicked shall not cease to fight you, untill they have, if they can accomplish ^t, mislead you from your Religion. His good works among you, that shall quit his Law, and die an Infidell shall be vaine in this world, and himselfe be confined in the fire of Hell; Such as bel^eve in God, that separate themselves from the impious, that abandon their houses for the service of his Divine Majestie, and that fight for the Faith, hope for his mercy, he is gracious and mercifull. They will enquire of thee concerning wine, and games of hazard; say unto them, that it is in them a very great sin, and yet of utility to men; but the evill that they cause, is much greater then the profit they reape. They will demand what they ought to expend in  ^ood works; say unto them, what shall remaine to you, your ^wne affaires being done. So God teacheth you his Com^andements, peradventure you will call to mind the things ^f earth and of heaven. They will enquire concerning Or^hans; say unto them if their substance bee intermingled ^ith your owne, doe them no wrong, they are your bre^^ren in God, he knoweth them that doe good, and those ^^t doe evill: if it had pleased him, he had detained much ^ore from you, for he is Omnipotent and just. Marry not ^omen that believe in many gods, untill they believe in one ^le God; a Slave that is a true believer, is of more va^^e then a free Infidell, notwithstanding she is beautifull. ^fidels shall be summoned to hell fire, and God calleth ^en to Paradise, and to his mercy, through his meere ^od pleasure, and declareth to them his Commandements, ^haps they will remember them. They will enquire of ^ee concerning the monthly terms of women; answer, ^^at they are uncleane; separate your selves from your ^ives when they are menstruous, and come not nigh them ^^till they bee purified; when they shall be cleane, ap^roach them, according to what God hath commanded: ^e loveth them that repent of their errors, that are cleane ^d purified; your wives are your tillage, goe to your til^ge at your pleasure, and doe good for your souls; you ^all one day find it, feare God and preach his Comman^^ments to the true believers. Your Religion doth not per^it you to sweare by God in vaine, and oftentimes to ^^stifie your selves; God understandeth and knoweth all ^ings, he will not regard what you shall speake at ran^ome, that shall not bee hurtfull to any, but he will see ^hat it shall be in your heart. He will be gracious and mer^ifull to such as shall sweare, not to touch their wives the ^ace of foure months if they returne to them; he is gra^ious and mercifull; but if they desire to repudiate them, ^e understandeth, and knoweth all things. Women di^orced, shall tarry untill their Termes be past foure times, ^efore they marry againe, it is not permitted them to con^eale what God hath created in their wombe, if they be^ieve in his divine Majesty, and the day of Iudgement, if  they flie from their husbands, they shall be brought aga^^ to them, which is a thing reasonable. They ought to ^nour them, and their husbands likewise ought to hono^^ them, but the husbands have a degree of advantage abo^^ them, God is Omnipotent, and most wife in what he (...) dameth. Divorce the first and second time, ought to b^ performed with mildnesse, courtesie, and good deeds; is not lawfull for you to take any thing from your wives, what you have given them, if you both feare a disability not satisfying the Commandements of God; but if y^^ both feare to transgresse the bounds prescribed by Go^ you shall doe well to accord together, such are the co^mandements of his divine Majesty, such as transgresse th^ are exceedingly too blame. He that shall have repudiated wife thrice, shall not resume her, untill she hath been m^ryed to another that hath divorced her: then they may (...) turne to each other, and marry againe without Sinne, they thinke themselves able to continue within the l^^ prescribed by God, which he manifesteth to the wise ^ prudent. When you shall repudiate your wives, appo^ them the time they must tarry, before they againe ma^ take them with civility and modestie, and in the like m^ner dismisse them, give them presents according to your ^bilities, and take them not, to abuse nor torment the^ they that doe this, offend their owne Souls. Mocke no^ the Commandements of God: Remember his favours, (...) how he hath taught you Scripture, knowledge and (...) mysteries of his law; Feare God, and know that he ^^derstandeth all your actions. When you repudiate y^^^ wives, appoint them the time they ought to tarry, be^^^^ they marry againe, and hinder them not to marry ac^^^ding to the Commandements of God. These things preached to them among you that believe in God, and the day of Iudgement, it is requisite so to make use^ them. God knoweth what you know not. The woman (...) give suck to their children two yeares entire, if they fire to accomplish the time appointed to suckle them, (...) father shall nourish and cloath the wife; and his childr^^ according to his faculties: expend not, but according  the measure of your goods: the father and mother shall not necessitate themselves for their children: the heire shall performe what is above ordained, he shall entertaine his father and mother according to his abilities;)See Gelaldin.) if the parents desire to weane their children before two years be expired, they may do it without offending God, if they both agree to it. If you cause your children to be nursed by other women then your own wives, God will not be offended, in giving them their sallary, according to reason and honesty: feare God, and know that he seeth what ever you doe. Widdows shall tarry foure months and ten nights after the death of their husbands, before they marry againe; this time being accomplished, they shall doe what shall seeme good to them, according to reason and honesty, God knoweth all your actions. You will not offend God in speaking a word in secret to women that you research in marriage, although you conceale in your mind your designe to espouse them, he understandeth what ever you thinke of them; know them not secretly, untill you have pronounced the words appointed by the Law; and enter not the bonds of marriage, untill the time set downe in writing be accomplished, God knoweth whatever is in your hearts: take heed unto your selves, he is gentle and gracious to them that feare him. It is no sin to repudiate your wives, before you have touched them; you shall give them some presents, and doe good unto them, according to the proportion of your wealth, or poverty; and civilly intreat them, as is the custome of honest men. If you repudiate them before you have touched them, and have bestowed on them any presents of garments, moveables, and other things, they shall have the moity, if they release it not to you, or if the husband, remitting with his owne hand the tie of marriage, doth not leave to them the whole, of courtesie: it is requisite to gratifie them, and to forget nothing of the benefits betweene you, God beholdeth all your actions: stand upon your guard, when you make your prayers, especially, that at noone, and be obedient unto God. If you feare your enemies, and cannot place your selves on your knees, neither performe the  Ceremonies that are appointed you; omit not to say you^ prayers on foote, or on horseback, and being freed fro^ feare, remember God, and how he hath taught you, what you know not. Such as die, shall be good to their wives by their Testament; they shall bestow on them wherewit^ to live during the time they must tarry before they marry again; drive them not from your houses: If they willingly depart, the sin of what they shall do in their own persons, shall not be upon you. God is omnipotent, and just; you shall likewise do good to your wives that you have divorced, according to your power, it is a thing reasonable among such as feare God: Thus God teacheth you his Commandements, perhaps you will learne them. See you not them that departed their houses for the fear they had of death? they are thousands in number; God hath said to them, die: after this, he raised them again: God is the Benefactor of the people, but the greatest part return him no thanks for his Favours. Fight for his Law, and know, that he understandeth and knoweth all things. Who is he that will afford him a good turne? He will augment him with multiplicity of increase; he giveth good, and taketh it away from whom it pleaseth him; you shall all returne before him to bee judged. Knowest thou not, that a company of the children of Israel, after the death of Moses, said to their Prophet, send us a King, we with him will fight for the Law of God? He answereth them, have you disobeyed the Commandements of God? If they enjoyne you to fight, you will not doe it: They said, wee have no greater desire, then to fight for the glory of his divine Majestie; wee for this Cause have abandoned our houses, and those of our parents: neverthelesse, when they were commanded to fight, they all, except some few of them, retired; but God knoweth them that sin against him. Their Prophet said to them, God hath sent Saul to be your King; they answered, why shall he be our King? we rather deserve the royalty then hee, hee is not rich enough; he replied, God hath chosen him to command you; he hat encreased his knowledge, and stature, he giveth royalty to whom he listeth, he is liberall and prudent in all his actions. Their Prophet said to them, the signe of his  reigne shall be, that the Arke shall appeare to you from God, to confirme your hearts; wherein shall be contained the remainder of what the people of Moses and Aaron let^, and it shall be borne by Angels; this shall bee to you the signe of his reigne, if you believe in God. When Saul went forth with his troops to fight his enemies he said, God shall trie you by a river; he that shall drink of that river, shall not be mine, unlesse he drink with his hand; they all, except some few of them drank at their pleasure; and having past that river with the true believers, they said, wee have ^ot this day strength sufficient to resist Goliah and his troops; but such as believed in God, and feared his divine Majestie, said, how often, through the permission of God, ^ath a small troop defeated a great armie? He is with them that are patient: when they saw Goliah with his troops appeare; they said, Lord, give us patience, confirme our steps, ^nd give us victory over the Infidels. They, through the permission of God, vanquished their enemies:See Gelaldin. David slew Goliah, and God gave him the Royalty, and knowledge of ^ture things. Had not God raised the people one against ^he other, the whole earth had been ful of disorders; such are ^he miracles of God, as I declare to thee with truth; thou ^t indeed one of the Prophets of his divine Majestie. We ^ave conferred our graces on the Prophets, on some more ^hen on others; many have spoken to their Lord, and some ^ave been more elevated then others. We gave knowledge ^o Iesus the Son of Mary, and fortified him through the holy Spirit. Had it pleased God, the Prophets that came ^eretofore, had not been slaine, after they had taught his Commandements. Men were of different opinions; some believed in God, others were impious; had it pleased God, ^hey had not been slaine, but he doth what pleaseth him. O ye that are true believers! dispense in alms some part ^f your wealth that we have given you, before the day arrive, wherein you shall find no ransome, alms, protection, nor prayers that can succour you. Certainly Infidels are greatly too blame. God! There is but one only God, living, and eternall; thinke not that he slumbreth or sleepeth: ^hat ever is in heaven or in earth is his; who shall intercede  for thee with his divine Majestie, unlesse by his permissio^ He knoweth all the actions of m^n, and whatever they ha^ done; they know nothing, but what it hath pleased hi^ teach them, The largenesse of his Throne containeth h^ven and earth, and the conservation of both is not trou^some to him, hee is Omnipotent and glorious. The ^ ought not to be abjured, it manifesteth the difference faith and impiety: He that believeth not in Tagot, or devill, and hath faith in God, layeth hold on the stron^ knot, that cannot be dissolved, broken, or cut a sunder. ^ understandeth and knoweth all things; he aideth and sisteth them that believe in his unitie; he will cause the^ come out of darkenesse, and will guide them into light: wicked shall have Tagot, and the devill for their protect^ he shall cause them to forsake the light, and shall lead t^ into darkenesse: such men shall remaine eternally in ^ fire of hell. Con^ider you not his action, to whom God (...) given the royalty?That is Nebrot. When he disputed concerning God (...) Abraham; Abraham said to him; My Lord is he that giv^ life,See Gelaldin. and death; He said, I, even I, give life and death (...) my subject, when I see good: Abraham answered, (...) causeth the Sun to rise in the East, make thou it to ari^^ the West; then the Infidell was confuted, God is n^^ guide to unjust persons. Hast thou considered the actio^ him that came into a Village desolate and ruined, and ^ How is it that God can be able to give life unto this ^lage after its death, and re-establish it after so great a^ine? Then God caused him to die, after the space of hundred years raised him againe, and said to him, How (...) hast thou continued here? he answered; I have sojoun^ here a day and a halfe; On the contrary, thou hast be^ here an hundred years; consider thy meat and drinke, (...) they are not altered through length of time; and beh^ thine Asse is death, see his bones, that are white; thou (...) become an example to all the world, and to posterity; the bones of thine Asse; I will recollect and revest t^^ with flesh: Seeing this miracle, he said, I affirme that (...) is omnipotent; Remember thou, that Abraham said, (...) shew me how thou revivest the dead; God said, D^  ^hou not believe my omnipotencie? Hee answered, yea Lord, but heare my prayer for the repose of my heart; God ^aid; Take foure birds, cut them altogether in pieces, and ^arry the pieces upon those mountains; this done, call them, ^hey shall speedily return to thee; God knoweth all things, ^nd is most prudent in all his works. The action of them that dispend their goods for his glory, is like unto a grain of Corn ^hat producerh seven ears, and every eare an hundred grains: God multiplieth the wealth of whom it pleaseth him, he is liberall and omniscient: Such as dispend their substance for ^is glory, without repining, and reproach, shall be recompen^ed by his Divine Majestie, and be delivered from feare and ^ffliction at the day of Iudgement. Good words and pardon ^re preferred to almes, followed with repentance: God is most rich and mercifull. Oh ye that believe in God! render not your almes unprofitable through repining and reproach, ^s do those, that give almes with ostentation and hypocrisie; they believe, neither in God, nor the day of Iudgement, their good works are like to a Rock, whereon was little earth, there fell great rain that carried it away, and left nothing thereon: their labour shall be in vaine, and they reap no merit, for God loveth neither the hypocrites nor the impious. The action of such as do good, to please God, or to save their soules, is like to a grain sown upon an high place, whereon fell great and small rain, that caused its fruit to multiply: God beholdeth all your actions. Is there any one among you that desireth to have a garden enriched with palmes, and grapes, wherein flow many fountains, and rivolets, and that is filled with all manner of fruits, that old age should overtake him with young and infirme children, and that an hot winde come, and burn up his garden? God so teacheth you his mysteries; peradventure you will bear them in minde. Oh ye that believe! dispend in pious works, and give almes of the wealth you have acquired, and of the fruits of the earth that God hath given you; desire not wealth ill gotten, or wherewith to give almes; such are not received but to your shame; And know, that God is most rich, and worthy of praise. The Divell will cause you to feare poverty, and will command you filthiness, and God promiseth  to you his grace and mercie; he is munificent, and omn^^ent he giveth knowledge to whom it pleaseth him, an^ whom knowledge is given, on him is bestowed an exceed great Treasure, which none but the wise do value; God holdeth your almes, and vowes, and the wicked shall be prived of protection at the day of Iudgement. If you s^ your almes to appeare, it shall not be amisse; if you ^ceale them, you shall do well, that will cover many of y^ sins; God knoweth all your actions. You are not obliged lead men into the right way, God guideth whom he liste^ the good and the almes that you performe, shall be for y^ soules; give not almes but for the love of God, you shall rewarded for the good works that you shall do, and no justice shall be done against you; Be benefactors to (...) poore, that are not accommodated for the service of G^^ and that cannot labour. The ignorant believe them to rich, by reason of their probitie and goodnesse, you sh^ know them by their Physiognomie, and in that they dema^^ nothing with importunitie; God will know the good y^ shall doe towards them; They that give almes, by day or night, secretly or publikely, shall be rewarded of Go^ there needeth be no feare for them, they shall be exem^ from affliction at the day of Iudgement; Vsurers shall r^ again, like to men possessed with Devils, because th^ have said, that traffique, is like unto usury; God permiteth traffique and prohibiteth Vsurie; hee to whom t^^ word of God commeth, and who hath abandoned us^rie, what is past, is to himselfe, God will pardon his fault but he that shall return to exercise usurie, having once abandoned it, shall be punished in the fire of Hell; God abhorreth usurie, he loveth them that are almes-givers, an^ hateth Infidels; Such as believe in God, that doe good works, and that make their prayers at the time appointed and pay their tithes, shall be rewarded by his Divine Majesty, they shall be delivered from feare and affliction at the day of judgement. O ye that believe in God! have the feare of him before your eyes, and forsake Vsurie. if you will obey his Commandements; if you doe not this, God and his Prophet will make warre upon you; if you be converted,  your principall remaines unto you; Do injustice to no man, it shall not be done unto you. If your debtors be ^nable to pay you, and a^e in want, you shall doe well to stay their conveniency; if you give them almes, you shall do well; feare the day when you shall return before God, and that every one shall be payed, without injustice, of what he shall have gained. O ye that believe in God! when you shall charge your selves with a debt, cause no act to be drawn; the Notarie shall write the Contract between you, conformable to Iustice, and shall not refuse ^o write it, as God hath instructed him, but the debtor shall entirely satisfie what he shall owe, and shall have the ^eare of his Lord before his eyes; If he that ^s a debtor is a foole, or sicke, and is unable of himselfe to discharge ^t, his guardian, or he that shall overse^ his affaires, shall give satisfaction for him. Call w^th you two witnesses, if ^ou cannot find two men, one, with two women shall suf^ice, whose testimonie you shall accept; if the one be ^anting to her duty, the other shall cause her to remember; these witnesses shall not refuse their testimonie, notwithstanding they bee called in a greater number. Make no difficultie to write your testimonie, whether it concerne little or much, and limit the time wherein payment ought to bee made; such writings are just before God, give more efficacy to testimonie, and are requi^^te ^o avoide your complaints one of another; If your merchandize be present, you shall take it betweene you at the same time, then shall you not sinne in not drawing a writing, or contract. Call witnesses when you sell or buy; neither the witnesses, nor the Notary shall receive any dammage; If you shall doe that which is forbidden, you shall doe very ill: Feare God, he will teach you his Commandements, he knoweth all things. If you are in a journey, and cannot find a Notary, you shall give earnest; If one trusteth in the other, he that shall be trusted in, shall satisfie his promise, and feare God his Lord; no man shall conceale his testimony, he that shall conceale, shall sinne in his heart; God knoweth all your actions. Whatsoever is in Heaven, or in Earth, belonging  unto God, whether you conceale, or reveale what in your minds, he shall require an account of you, he p^^doneth, and chastiseth whom it pleaseth him, he is o^nipotent. The Prophet believed in all that God sent him, as likewise all the true believers: Such as believe God, the Angels, and Scriptures, and generally all (...) Prophets, without exception, say, We have heard (...) obeyed; Pardon us oh Lord! Thou art our refuge; G^^ requireth of no man more then he is able to peeform the good that a man shall doe, shall be for himselfe, (...) the evill that he doth shall be likewise agninst him. L^^ excuse us, if wee have forgotten thee, or sinned; L^^ charge us not with any heavy burthen, as thou di^charge them that were before us; charge us not with t^^^ which we are not able to suport, blot out our sinnes, (...) give us thy mercy; Thou art our Lord, give us victory ^gainst the Infidels.   CHAP. III. The Chapter of the Lienage of Ioachim, containing two h^^dred verses, written at Medina. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull; I am (...) most wise God God! There is but one only God, ^^ving, and eternall; He hath sent to thee the Book (...) containeth truth, and confirmeth the Scriptures, (...) were sent before it. He sent the Old Testament, and (...) Gospell, that were heretofore guides to the people; (...) hath sent the Alcoran, that distinguisheth good from ^vill; they that believe not in the Law of God, shall (...) severely chastised. He is omnipotent and revengefull: N^thing is hid from him in Heaven, or in Earth; It is (...) that formed you in the wombes of your mothers, as it pl^^sed him, there is no God, but the omnipotent, and (...) God. He it is that sent to thee the Book, whose prece^^^^ are necessary,See Kitab el tenoir. they are the originall, and foundation the Law, like in puritie one to the other, and with  contradiction. Such as in their heart incline to depart from the truth, doe often follow their inclination, desirous of sedition, and to understand the explication of the Alcoran; but none understand its explication, but God, and such as are profound in learning; they say, we believe in God, all things proceed from his divine wisdome, neverthelesse none remember, ^ut the wise. Lord cause not our hearts to erre, after thou hast guided us into the right way, give us thy mercy, thou art most bountifull towards thy creatures. Lord thou art hee that shalt assemble the world at the day of Iudgement, at which day nothing shall be found doubtfull, when thou wilt not goe against thy promises, and when wealth and children shall not serve to the wicked, but to kindle the fire of Hell. The Infidell lineage of Pharoah, and those that preceded him, blasphemed and abjured the Law of God, but he surprized them in their sinne; hee is grievous in his chastisements. Say to the Infidels, they shall be vanquished, and shall be gathered together into the fire of Hell, that is prepared for them. You have an example in the two Troops that fought for the glory of God, they beheld with their eyes, Infidels become true believers, like unto themselves; God strengthneth with his aide, whom it pleaseth him; this shall be for example to such as shall cleerly see. The love and desire of women, of children, of riches, abundance of gold, and of silver, of horses, cattell, and of tillage, are pleasing to men; such are the riches of the life of this world, but the most assured refuge is in God. Say unto them; I will declare unto you things much better for them, that shall have the feare of God before their eyes: they shall dwell eternally in Paradise, where flow many rivers, with women beautifull, and leane, and all manner of content. God beholdeth them that adore him, and that say, Lord we believe in thy Law, pardon our sinnes, and deliver us from the torments of fire. The patient, the persevering, true believers, the obedient, the good men, such as beg pardon of God in the morning; the Angels, the Learned, that love Iustice, testifie that there is but one only God. The Law of salvation,  is a Law pleasing to his divine Majestie; no man contradicteth this truth, among The Iews and Christians. such as know the written Law, but through envie. He that shall not obey the Commandements of God, shall find his divine Majesty very exact to call him to an accompt.See Gelaldin. If the impious dispute with thee; say to them, I am wholy resigned to the will of God,The Iews and Christians. with all such as have followed me. Aske of such as know the written Law, and them that know it not, if they resigne themselves to God; if they doe, they will follow the right way;The Arabians. if they goe astray, thou hast none other obligation, but to preach to them; God beholdeth them that adore him.See Kitab el tenoir. Declare grievous torments to those that conceale his Commandements, that kill the Prophets, and injure them that instruct the people in Iustice; the good works that they doe, shall be unprofitable to them on earth, and they shall be in the other world d^prived of protection. Seest thou not a partie of them that know the written Law, how they were called to a Lecture of the Book of God, to the end they might judge with equitie the differences that are among them? but many are returned to their sinne: they contemned the Scripture, in that they said, the fire shall not touch us, but for a certain number of dayes; They are deceived in their blasphemies, what will become of them, when we shall assemble them at the day of Iudgement, when nothing shall be doubtfull, and every one shall be recompensed, as he shall have merited? No in justice shall be done unto them. Say, Lord thou possessest the Kingdomes of the world, thou givest Royalty to whom thou seest good; from thy hand, oh Lord, proceedeth all good, thou art Omnipotent, thou causest day to enter the night, and night the day; thou causest life to come out of death, and death out of life; thou enrichest without measure whom thou seest good. The believers shall not obey the unbelievers, to the exclusion of true believers; he that doth this thing, ^bserveth not the Law of God; but if you feare your enemies, God willeth that you feare him also, he is the assured refuge of the righteous; say to them whether you conceale what is in your heart, or whether you manifest it,  God knoweth all things; he knoweth all that is either in Heaven or Earth, he is Omnipotent; Think on the day wherein every one shall find the good and the evill that he hath done, then shall you desire to be cleansed from your sinnes,See Gelaldin. and that the number of your good works exceed that of your evill. God willeth that you feare him, he is gracious to them that worship him. Say to them, If you love God, follow me, God shall give you life, and pardon your sinnes, he is gracious and mercifull. Say to them, obey God and his Prophet; If they returne in their sinne* God will very severely punish them, he loveth not Infidels. God elected Adam, and Noah, the lineage of Abraham, and the lineage of Joachim, the one proceedeth from the other, God knoweth and understandeth all things. Remember thou, how the wife of Joachim said. Lord I vow unto thee the fruit that is in my wombe, free,See Kitab el tenoir. and exempt from all affaires, to serve thee in thy Temple: Accept him from me, who offer him to thee with affection: thou understandest and knowest all things: When shee was delivered, shee said, Lord I am delivered of a Daughter, thou knowest thou hast given her to me; I have named her Mary, I will preserve through thine assistance, her and her posterity from the malice of the Devill; accept her Lord, with a pleasing acceptation, and cause her to produce good fruits. Zachary had the care of the education of this daughter, and whensoever hee went into his Oratorie, he there found a thousand sorts of different fruits of divers seasons. He said one day, oh Mary! whence doe these good things proceed? she answered, they proceed from God, who enricheth without measure whom he pleaseth. Then Zachary prayed to the Lord, and said, Lord give me a progenie that may bee pleasing to thee, and that may observe thy Commandements; Lord heare my prayers. The Angels called him, and said to him; I declare to thee from God, that thou shalt have a sonne, called John,See Gelaldin. he shall affirme the Messias to be the word of God, that he shall be a great person, chaste, a Prophet, and one of the just: Lord, answered, Zachary, how shall I have a sonne, I am old, and  my wife is barren? The Angell said to him, so God doth as pleaseth him: Lord, said Zachary, give me some signe of the conception of my wife: The signe, that I will give thee, answered the Angell, shall be, that thou shalt not speake in three dayes, but by signes; Remember thou thy Lord often, praise him evening and morning. Remember thou, how the Angels said, Oh Mary, God hath chosen and purified thee above all women of the world; oh Mary, obey thy Lord, praise him, and worship him with them that worship him. I relate to thee how the matter past: thou wert not with the Ministers of the Temple, when they cast in their pens to draw lots, and to see which of them should have the care of the education o^ Mary,Oh Mahomet. neither when they entred upon this difficulty. Remember thou how the Angels said, oh Mary, God declareth unto thee a word, from which shall proceed the Messias, named Iesus the sonne of Mary, full of honour in this world, and that shall be in the other, of the number o^ Intercessors with his divine Majestie; hee shall speak^ in the cradle, as a man betwixt thirty and fifty years and shall be in the number of the just: She said, Lord how shall I have a child without the touch of a man? he answered, so God doth as pleaseth him; when he createt^ any thing, he saith, be thou, and it is. I will teach him the Scriptures, the Mysteries of the Law, the Old Testament, and the Gospell, and he shall be a Prophet sent to the children of Israel. Iesus said to the children of Israel, I come to you with evident signs of my mission from your Lord, I will make unto you of the slime of the earth* the figure of a Bird, I will blow upon it, incontinently it shall be a Bird, and by the permission of God, shal fly; I wil heal them that are borne blind, and the leprous, I will raise again the dead, I wil teach you what you shal eat, and what you ought not to eate; this shall serve you for instruction, if you believe in God; I am come to confirme the old Testament, and what hath been taught you heretofore. Certainly it is lawfull for you to eat things that have been heretofore forbidden. I am come to you with signs of my mission, that testifie that I am truly sent from your Lord;  ^^are God, and obey me, God is my Lord, and your Lord, ^orship him, this is the right way. When Iesus knew ^heir impiety, he said, who shall sustaine the Law of God (...) my absence? The Apostles answered him, we will sustain ^^e Law of God, we believe in his unity; be thou a wit^esse before God, that we resign our selves wholly to the ^leasure of his divine Majestie. Lord we believe in what ^hou hast commanded, and we have followed the Pro^het, thy Apostle, write us in the number of them that ^rofesse thy Law. The Iews conspired against Iesus, and God caused their conspiracie to turne against them, hee ^noweth the designs of Conspirators. Remember thou, ^ow the Lord said, O Iesus, I will cause thee to die, I ^ill elevate thee to my self, and remove thee farre from ^nfidels, and preferre those that have obeyed thee, to Infidels, at the day of Iudgement. That day shall assemble you all before me; I will judge the differences between you, and will punish the impious, in this world, and in the other; none among them shall be of power to protect them, I will reward them that shall have believed in my Law, and have done good works; God loveth not the unjust. I relate to thee these mysteries, and teach thee the Alcoran; Iesus is with God, as is Adam, God created him of the Earth; he said, be thou, and he was: this truth proceedeth from thy Lord, be not thou of the number of them that doubt; If any one dispute with thee concerning thy Doctrine, say to them, Come, call together your children and ours, your wives and ours, let us assemble and addresse our prayers to God; I will lay the curse of his divine Majesty upon lyars This discourse is most true, there is no God, but God alone the omnipotent, and wise. If they depart from his Commandements, he shall well observe the unbelievers; say to them, Th^ Iew^ and Christians. Oh ye that know Scripture! come with words alike true betweene you and us; Doe I worship other then God? I doe not associate him with any one, and acknowledge none other Lord but him; but if they turne aside from the way of faith; God knoweth them that shall pollute the Earth; Say to them, bee yee witnesses that we believe in God.  Oh ye that understand Scripture, dispute not the Law (...) Abraham, to wit, if he observed the Old Testament, (...) the Gospell, they were taught after him, perhaps you w^ acknowledge your errour. Oh yee that have disput^ wh^t you knew not! Abraham was no Jew, nor Christia^ he professed the unity of God, he was a true believer, a^^ not of the number of Infidels. The people, and partic^larly those that followed him, of his time, as also the Pr^phet Mahomet, and all true believers have knowne t^ truth of his Law. Part of them, to whom heretofore w^ given the knowledge of Scripture desired, seduced y^ from the right way, but they themselves erred, and th^^ knew it not. Oh yee that know the Scripture! doe n^ maliciously conceale the Commandements of God, co^ not the Truth with a lye, neither willingly hide it. M^ny of them that know the written Law, said from t^ break of day, believe in what hath been taught them, th^ believe in the Law of God: Neverthelesse, at evenin^ they were themselves of the number of Infidels, pera^venture they will be converted. Believe not, but such (...) follow your own Law; Say to them, The true guide, the guide of God. The knowledge that was given to you was not given to ^ny other, but to you: If the Infide^ shall dispute against you, before your Lord, at the day (...) judgement; say to them, Grace proceedeth from th^ hand of God: He is bountifull, and omniscient; he p^^doneth whom he pleaseth, and is altogether mercifull. (...) thou intrustest thy wealth to the hands of many of the^ that know the written Law, they will faithfully resto^^ it to thee* There be also many of them that will n^^ restore it, if thou take not heed; because they have said* They have no beliefe in the Arabians, they blaspheme against God, and know their blasphemies. He that sha^ satisfie what he hath promised, and shall feare God, shal^ be beloved of God; he loveth such as have fear of him before their eyes; such as pervert his Commandements fo^ any profit, shall have no part in Paradise; he will not protect them, neither regard, or pardon them at the day (...)  judgement; and they shall be rigorously punished. There ^e of them, that alter the Scripture in reading it, and will make believe that what they read, is in the Scripture, al^hough it be not; they blaspheme, and know it well. God ^^ve not to man the Scripture, knowledge, and prophesies, to say to the people, Worship me insteed of God; ^ut indeed, to say, Observe exactly what you have learned (...) Scripture, and what you reade. God doth not command ^ou to adore Angels, nor Prophets: Will he command you ^^piety, having instructed you in his Law? Remember ^hat he received the Promise of the Prophets, to preach ^is Commandements without fear, and that he hath taught ^ou Scripture; and knowledge; and that after this,See Kitab el tenoir. came a Prophet, that confirm'd the doctrine that was taught you, ^hat you might believe his words. Have you not approved (...)? Have you not received what was promised unto you? We have received it; be therefore witnesses against your selves, and against them that have followed you, and I will be a witnesse against you, and against them. Such as ^oe astray from the right way, shall be wicked; Desire they ^o observe any other Law, then that of God? Whatever is in Heaven, or Earth, obeyeth him; either willingly, or by force: And you shall all one day appeare before him, to be judged: Say to them, We beleeve in God, in what he hath inspired into us, in what he inspired into Abraham, Ismael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, in what was ordained by Moses, by Jesus, and generally all the Prophets from God; and we are wholly resigned to his pleasure. The Sacrifices of them that desire to follow other Law, then the Law of Salvation, shall not be accepted; they shall be in the other world, in the number of the damned. God guided not those that followed impiety, after they had professed his Law; and having seene, and testified that the Prophet is true, by signes, cleare and evident, that appeared to them. God guideth not the unjust, they shall be for ever cursed of his divine Majestie of Angels, and of all the world; they shall find no relaxation of their torments, and at the day of judgment be deprived of protection; except such as shal be converted, and do good works,  God shall bee to them gracious and mercifull.See Kitab el tenoir. Such shall be impious towards Iesus, having believed the Boy of Moses, and shall augment their impiety against Mohomet, shall never be converted, they shall erre etern^^^ly. All the treasures of the Earth shall not be able to sa^ the wicked that die in their impiety, great punishmen^ are prepared for them, and none of them shall be able (...) protect them. You shall not be justified, untill you ha^ dispensed in pious works, part of the goods you posse^^ God will take notice of the alms you bestow. All me^ were permitted the children of Israel, except what Is^ forbad to himself,See Kitab el tenoir. before the old Testament; Say to the Come, and bring the old Testament, and consider it, will appeare if you speak the Truth. These that shall ^^terwards blaspheme against God, shall be exceedin^ too blame. Say, God hath spoken Truth, follow ye (...) Law of Abraham, that is pleasing to him: He profe^ the unity of his Divine Majesty; he was not of them t^ believed in many Gods. The Temple of Mecca is the (...) that God established on Earth, to be therein adored; blessed it, and men shall there find the instructions of (...) right way, with clear and evident signes of his omni^^tency; to wit Abrahams place (say the Turks) is a Stone kept in the Oratory of Mecca, upon which, Abraham ascended, when hee raised the foundations of the Temple of that City: the marks of his feet are upon the Stone to this day. Abrahams place: He that shall enter to this Temple, shall be in a place of safety and pri^^ledge. God hath commanded that Pilgrimages be m^^ thither, by such as shall be able. He that is impious, (...) know that God hath not to doe with him. O ye that h^^ knowledge of the written Law, doe not willingly co^ceale the Commandements of God, he knoweth all yo^ actions; Say to them, O ye that have the knowledge (...) Scriptures, divert not from the way of Salvation th^ that believe in the Law of God; you desire to alter, (...) pervert it, but God is not ignorant of what you doe. (...) ye that believe, if you obey many of them that have (...) knowledge of the written Law, they will mis^lead you i^ the number of the wicked. How can you bee of the i^pious, since you are taught the Commandements of G^^ and that his Prophet, and his Apostle is among yo^ Hee that resigneth himselfe to God, is in the rig^  (...), O ye that fear God, die in the profession of his V^y, imbrace his Law, and remember the favor he hath ^wed you: you were all enemies of each other; he hath ^ed your hearts, and through his speciall Grace you ^^tinued united to each other as good brethren: you ^e upon the brink of a pit of fire, from which he with^^ you. Thus God manifesteth to you his mercies, per^^ you will follow the right way. Some there be among (...), that exhort the people to do good; they command to ^hat which is honest, and abstain from what is unreaso^^^le; these men shall be happy: Be not like them that ^e abandoned the Truth, and followed lies; notwith^^nding the Truth was known to them, they shall suffer ^at torment in the day wherein the visage of the good ^ll be white, and that of the wicked shall be black. It ^ll be said to them that have black visages; Have you ^owed impiety, after you made profession of the Faith? ^ste this day the torment due to your sin. Such as shall ^e white visages, shall be in the favor of God; in which ^y shall eternally continue. See there the Mysteries of (...) Law of God, which instructeth thee with Truth. God ^leth that no injustice be done to his people; whatever ^n Heaven, or in Earth, appertaineth to him, he dispo^th all things. There hath appeared no Nation on the ^^rth that hath followed a better way then you; forbid (...) to do that which is not reasonable, and believe in one ^ely God;The Iews If those that heretofore had knowledge of ^e written Law, had believed in God, they had done ve^^ well; there be among them that believe what is verita^^e, but the greatest part are impious. They shall not hurt ^^u, but with their tongue, and shall finde no protection ^gainst you; if they fight you, they shall turn their ^cks; they were beaten with shame and ignominy, where ^hey made a stand, except, when they embraced the Law ^f God, and observed the precepts that were taught the ^aithfull: When they returned in the wrath of God, they were beaten with poverty; because they believed not the word of his Divine Majesty, but slew his Prophets without reason, and disobeyed his Commandements. They  that heretofore had knowledge of the written Law, not all alike: there be among them that persevere obedience, and in the night meditate on the miracle God, worship him, and believe in his Divine Maj^ and the day of Iudgement; preach honesty, prohibit do things dishonest, and apply themselves to good wo^ certainly, they are good men. Hide not the good w^ which you perform, God knoweth such as have his (...) before their eyes.

There were ^^retofore Laws and Means to conduct men into the right ^y; but consider what hath bin the end of Infidels. The ^lcoran was sent to instruct the world, to guide men in the ^^ght way, and to preach to the good. Dishearten not, nei^^er afflict your selves in fighting; you shall be victorious, you believe in God; if you have been wounded, the like ^^rts have befallen the impious. God so diversifieth days ^mong men, to the end he may know them that are truly ^ealous in his Law; and that among you, witnesses be taken ^gainst the malice of Infidels. God loveth not the unjust ^e forgiveth sins to those that believe, and extirpate Infi^els. Do you believe to enter Paradise, and that God know^th not them that fought gallantly? He knoweth them that  were patient in adversity, and persevered in obedien^ his Commandements. You expected death before yo^ it;At the battell of Beder. you saw it with your eyes, and were victorious. ^^^tainly Mahomet is the Prophet, and Apostle of God* were many Prophets before him; when they died, on slain, you returned upon your steps to impiety: The^ return upon their steps, do no harm to God; he w^ ward onely such as acknowledge his favors; and me^ not die without his permission, and that in a time p^ bed and predestinate.

They ^^nceale in their souls, what they publish not, and say, had ^e been free of our own wills, we had not been slain; say (...) them, although you had stayed in your houses, and in our beds, death would have taken away them that were ^rived at the houre of their destinie; God approveth ^hat is in your hearts, and knoweth what you have in our soules: Certainly the Devill seduced them that fled, ^hen the two Armies were in battell, and that, because of ^me sinne they had committed; neverthelesse God par^oned them, he is gracious and mercifull to his people. Oh ^ee that believe! be not like the Infidels, that said, spea^ing of their breathren that were slain in the Armie; ^hat had they continued in their houses, they had not ^^ed; God putteth this sorrow in their heart, because of ^heir impietie; he giveth life and death, and beholdeth all ^our actions; if you be slain for his Law, or die in his fa^our, it shall be more advantagious to you then all the ^^easures of the world; and if you die, or be slain, fight^^g for the Faith, you shall appeare before his divine Ma^estie to be rewarded: Through the grace of God thou ^ast rendred them docile; although thou bee severe (...) them, they will not depart from thee, pardon them, ^ray for them.

Those that obeyed God and the Prophet, after being, overcome that did good works, and feared his divine Majestie, shall receive great rewards. When it was told them, the people have conspired against you* take heed to your selves; this discourse increased the^ faith; and they said, it sufficeth that God is our protector, they were filled with the grace of God, no more evill befell  them, and they observed the Commandements of his ^ivine Majestie. He is gracious to them that obey him. The Devill will cause in you a fear of the Infidels, fear ^hem not; but if you be good men, fear me. Afflict not ^our selves to see the wicked run to impietie, they hurt not God, he will not give them rest in the other world, where they shall be severely chast^sed. I increase the wealth of Infidels to augment their pain, they shall in the ^nd feele grievous torments. God will not leave the faithfull in the state that you are in; he will one day separate ^he good from the evill; he doth not teach you what is to ^ome; he, for that effect chuseth among the Prophets whom he seeth good. Believe therefore in God, and his Prophets; if you believe in God, fear to offend him, you shall be rewarded. Believe that such as are too sparing, ^nd avaritious of the wealth that God hath given them, do well; on the contrary, they do very ill, what they spare without reason, shall strangle them at the day of Iudgement. The inheritance of heaven and earth is Gods, he knoweth all things. Certainly God heard the speech of them that said, God is poor, and we are rich; hee hath said, I will write what they have spoken, and keep an ex^ct account of the murther they have unjustly committed on the persons of the Prophets; I will say to them at the day of Iudgement, taste of the torments of hell fire, which you have deserved. God doth not lead into darknesse them that worship him. There be that say, God hath commanded us not to believe the Prophets, untill their sacrifice be consumed by fire: say to them, there came to you Prophets heretofore with miracles that you demanded, you had not slain them, had you been righteous; if they bely thee, know, they belyed the Prophets that were before thee, that came with miracles, the Psalter, and the book of light. Every man shall taste of death, and your reward shall be payed at the day of Iudgement; he that shall depart from the fire of hell, and enter into Paradise, shal be happy. The wealth of this world is but matter of Pride, that you may be tried in your riches and persons. Hearken not to the Iews and Christians, that have known  the written Law before you, neither to them that belie^ in many gods, they offend God through their blasphemie if you have patience, and fear God, you shall make a ver^ good resolution. God hath accepted the speech of the that know his written Law, when they promised him (...) preach to the people his Commandements, and not co^ceal them; neverthelesse they have contemned them, a^ changed them for profit of little value, and have gain^ nothing but misery; think not that such as rejoyce of th^ evill they have done, and affect to be commended (...) what they have not done, have escaped the punishme^ of their crimes, they shall certainly suffer great torment The kingdome of heaven and of earth is Gods, he is O^nipotent; the Creation of heaven and earth, the diff^rence of day and night are evident signs of his Omnip^tencie, to such as have judgement. Such as have, remember God, standing, sitting, or lying down, and consider^ the creation of Heaven and Earth have said, Lord, the hast not created* these things in vain; blessed be th^ Name, deliver us from the torments of hell fire, thou w^ render miserable him that thou shalt thither precipitat^ and the wicked shall be deprived of protection at the da^ of Iudgement. Lord, we have heard them that say, believe in your Lord, we believe in thy unity, pardon o^ faults, blot out our sins, and give us grace to die in th^ number of the just; bestow on us what thou hast pro^^sed by the Prophets, and suffer us not to be miserable a^ the day of Iudgement; thou dost not contradict wh^ thou dost prom^se. The Lord heard them, and said (...) them, I will not suffer your works to be lost, as well (...) men as of women. I will blot out the sins of them tha^ went out of Mecca, to separate themselves from the wi^ked; I will cover the offenses of them that forsook thei^ houses, that assembled to fight for the Faith, and we^ flain; I will open to them the gate of Paradise, wherein flow many rivers, to recompence their good woorks. There is with God great reward: envie not the Infidels, who^ thou shalt see posiesse a little wealth in the earth, hell is prepared to be their habitation; and such as fear Go^  shall dwell eternally in gardens, wherein run many rivers, with all manner of content. God is a great rewarder of the iust. Among them that know the written Law, there be, that believe in God, in what was afore time taught you, and in what was preached to them, surely they obey God, and forsake not his Law: They shall receive a great reward from God, he is exact in his account. O ye that are true believers, be patient in your adversities, persevere to doe well, fight for the Faith, feare God, and you shall be happy.   CHAP. IV. The chapter of women, containing one hundred and seventy Verses written at Medina. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull.Kitab el tenoir. O ye people, feare your Lord that created you of one sole person, and created his wife of his rib, of whom issued many men and women. Feare God, by whom you sweare, and say, the belly The ancient Arabians swore by by the name of God, and the belly of their wives because they feared their sterility. of your wives, God exactly observeth your actions. Give unto orphans what appertaineth to them; and render not evill for good; devoure not their substance, it is a very great sin. If you feare to doe injury to Orphans, feare also to doe wrong to women; marry those that please you, two, three, or foure: if you apprehend you shall not be able to entertaine them equally; marry but one, or the slaves that you shall have acquired; this is most necessary, to the end you offend not God. Give to women their dowry with a good will; if they give to you any thing that is pleasing to you, receive it with affection, and civility. Bestow not on fools the wealth that God hath given you for subsistance; assist Orphans, give to them the garments that shall be necessary for them, and entertaine them honestly; instruct them untill they have attained to years of discretion, and are capable of marriage; if you believe they demeane themselves wisely, restore to them their faculties, and devoure them not unjustly  before they be of age. He that shall be rich, shall abstain from their goods, and he that is poore, shall take with honesty, according to the pains he shall undergoe for them: when you make to them restitution of their goods, take witnesse of your action, God loveth good accounts. The children shall have a good part of what their father, and mother, and parents left after their decease, of little or of much there appertaineth to them a portion prefixed and limitted. When they divide their goods, the kindred shall have care of the poore and Orphans; doe good to them, and honestly entertaine them. Such as feare to leave after them a weak progeny of little children, ought to feare to wrong Orphans, they must feare God, and courteously entertaine them. Those that unjustly devoure their substance, swallow fire into their bowels, and shall burne in a great fire. God recommendeth to you your children, the son shall have as much as two daughters; if there be more then two daughters, they shall have two thirds of the succession of the dead; if there be but one,See Bedaci. she shall have the moity, and her kindred a sixth part of what shall be left by the dead: if there be no children, and the kindred be heires, the mother of the dead shall have a third; if there be brethren, the mother shall have a sixth, after satisfaction of the legacies contained in the Testament, and of debts. You understand not to whom it is most requisite to doe good, to your children, or to your father and mother, give them their portion ordained of God. The moity of what their wives shall leave belongeth to you, if they have no children; if they have, you shall have the fourth part of what they shall leave, after payment of the legacies and debts: they shall have the fourth of your succession, if you have no children; if you have, they shall have the eighth portion. If a man of woman be the heires of each other, and have neither father nor mother, nor children, and have a brother or sister, each of them shall have a sixth part of the succession; if they be more, they shall share the third, after payment of legacies and debts, without fraud, following what God hath ordained, he knoweth all your  actions, and is prudent in what he ordaineth, it is so ordained by his divine Maiesty. He that shall obey him, and his Prophet, shall enter into Paradise, where many rivers flow, and shall dwell in eternall felicity; he that shall disobey God and his Prophet, shall be cast head-long nto the fire of hell, where he shall suffer ignominious torments. If your wives commit adultery, take four witnesses of their fault, that be of your Religion; if they bear witness, keep them prisoners in your houses untill death, or untill God shall otherwise ordaine; punish whoremongers, concubines, and adulterers; if they repent of their fault, doe them no harme, God is gracious and mercifull to them that repent. Conversion dependeth on God, he is mercifull to them that commit sin ignorantly, and speedily repent, he is Omniscient, and most wise. Pa^don is not for them that doe wickedly, to the very houre of their death, we have prepared great torments for them that shall die impious. O ye that believe in God! it is not lawfull for you to inherit what is your wives by force, take not violently away what you have given them, unlesse they be surprized in manifest adultery; see them with civility, if you have an avertion from them, it may chance that you hate a thing, wherein God hath placed much good; but if you desire to repudiate your wives, to take others, and that you have given them any thing, take not any thing that appertaineth to them. Wil you take their wealth with a lie and a manifest sin? How shall you take it, since you have approached each other, and that you have promised to use them civilly? Marry not the wives of your fathers; what is past was incest, abomination, and a wicked way. Your Mothers are forbidden you, your Daughters, Sisters, Aunts, Neices, your Nurses, and your foster-sisters, the mothers of your wives, the daughters that your wives have had by other husbands, of whom you shall have a particular care: The daughters of women that you shall have knowne, are also forbidden you; if you have not knowne them, it will be no sin: the wives of your sons are likewise prohibited, and two sisters; for what is past, God is gracious and mercifull: Married  wives are likewise forbidden you, except the women slaves, that you shall have acquired. God hath so commanded you, except what is above forbidden, it is lawfull for you to marry at your pleasure. If you desire women for money, and neither commit concubinage, nor adultery, give them their salary for which you shall agree, so you shall not offend God, he is omniscient, and most wise. He that shall not be able to espouse women of free-condition, shall marry such women or maids, that are slaves, as shall please him. God knoweth the faith of the one, and other. Marry your wives with the permission of their parents, and give them their dowry with honesty: If women of free-condition, that have committed neither concubinage, nor adultery, secretly nor publikely, flie into second nuptials, and come to commit adultery, they shall be doubly punished, more then the daughters of Love.See Gelaldin. The marriage of slaves is for them that fear whordom: If you abstain from marrying them, you shall not do amiss. God is gracious and mercifull; he is willing to teach you his Law, and direct you in the way of them that preceded you; he is gracious and mercifull to his people. Such as follow the appetite of the wicked, decline extreamly from the Truth. God willeth that his Law be Light unto you, for that man was created weak. O you that believe in God, devour not your substance among you with ufury; but if you traffique, be peaceable in your affairs; slay not one another, God is mercifull to them that obey him: He that disobeyeth, through malice and iniustice, shall burn in the fire of Hell; it is an easie thing to God to punish them. If you depart from mortal sins, I will cover your faults, and cause you to enter into Paradise: covet not through envie, what God hath given to your neighbor; men and women shall have the wealth they have gained; beg Grace of God, he knoweth all things. Give to your associates what appertaineth to them. We have ordained a portion, prefixt to the one and the other, in the succession of your Father, Mother, and Kindred, God seeth all. The men shall have authority over the women; they shall have them in their  keeping; they shall have in their power the wealth that God shall give them; and shall have care of what shall be convenient to be expended for them. Discreet and obedient wives observe, in the absence of their husbands, the Commandements of God, make remonstrances to them that shall be disobedient, and remove them from your Bed, chastise them. If they obey you, seek not occasion to abuse them uniustly. God is most high, and most mighty. If you fear there may happen some difference between a man and his wife, send to them some of their Kindred, to put an end to their quarrel, and reconcile them. God wil give his peace to them, he is omniscient. Worship God, and say not that he hath a companion equall to him; do good to your Father, and Mother, your Kindred, Orphans, the Poor, your Neighbors, Pilgrims, your Friends, and your Slaves. God loveth not the proud. We have prepared rigorous torments for them that are avaricious, that recommend avarice to the people, that conceal the Graces that God hath bestowed on them, and that are impious. Such as dispend their wealth with hypocrisie, believe neither in God, nor the day of Iudgement; and those that shall have the Devil for their companion, will be in exceeding bad company; he shall not approach them, if they believe in God, and the day of Iudgement, and give Alms in some part of the riches God hath given them. God knoweth them, and doth no iniustice to any one, of the weight of a small Ant. If the righteous do good of the quantity of a Pismire, God shall multiply it, and give them a great reward. In what condition will Infidels be at the day of Iudgement; for that we have witnesses of all Nations against their impiety* and that we will call thee for a witnesse against them of their deportments? That day, the Infidels that have disobeyed the Prophet, shall def^^e to be consumed, like to the Earth; and not to have concealed or altered, through their discourse, the Commandments of God. O you that believe, make not your prayers, being drunk, untill you know what you speak; neither likewise being polluted, unless in passing on the way, untill you be cleansed; if you be in a iourney, or sick, or  go to discharge your belly, or have known your wives and find no water to wash you, you shall lay hand upon the sand, and wipe your face and hands. God is graciou^ and mercifull to his Creatures. Seest thou not how thos^ that know the written Law, purchase Error? how the desire to mis-lead you through their riches, and divert yo^ from the right way? God knoweth your enemies, it is enough that he is your defender and protector. Such (...) Judaize, alter the word of God, say to the Prophet^ We have heard, and disobeyed thee, they heard withou^ hearing; they say, preserve us, have a care of us; neverthelesse do they pervert the word of God, in reading it and alter his Commandements, they should doe better t^ say, Lord we have heard, and obeyed; hearken onely t^ us, and regard us: But God hath cursed them, and f^^ of them will believe in his Divine Maiesty, O you tha^ have knowledge of the Scriptures I believe in the Alcoran that confirmeth the old and new Testament, before that (...) deface your visages, and cause them to turn behind your backs.He speaketh to the Iewes and Christians. I will curse Infidels, as I have cursed them of the Sabbath; the Commandement of God is incontinently executed; he pardoneth not them that associate him with companions equall to him, except this, he forgiveth sins to whom it pleaseth him: He that saith God hath companions, blasphemeth, and mortally sinneth. Consider not such as affirm themselves to be good men; contrariwise, God maketh those good men that please him; no iniustice shall befall them at the day of Iudgement. Consider how they blaspheme, it is sufficient that God manifestly beholdeth their sin. Seest thou not them that have knowledge of the written Law, that believe in Habot and Tago^, Idols; that say to the Infidels, Behold the way of them that believe in God? Certainly, God hath cursed them; he, whom he curseth, shall find none to protect him. Shall they alone have part in the kingdome of Heaven, without giving Alms? They will envy their Neighbour, for the favours God hath conferred on him. Certainly, we gave to the posterity of Abraham, the knowledge of the Scriptures, and Prophecies; we bestowed  ^n them great abundance of wealth. There were of them ^hat believed in the Scripture, and others that contemned (...); but they shall be punished in the fire of Hell. I will ^ause them to burn, and change their burned skin into ^ new skin, that they may suffer the more. God is omnipotent, and prudent in what he ordaineth. I will cause ^hose that have believed in God, and have performed good works, to enter into Gardens, wherein flow many Rivers, where they shall dwell eternally with most beau^ifull women. I will give them to enter the shade of Paradise: God recommendeth to you, Fidelity among your selves, to render faithfully what hath been intrusted to you; and when you shall iudge differences that shall happen among the people, iudge with equity. It is a good work that he commandeth you; he beholdeth, and knoweth all things. O ye that believe! obey God, and the Prophets, and such as command over you; if you be in controversie concerning any point, refer it to God, and his Prophet, to understand the Exposition; if you believe in God, and the day of Iudgement, you shall do well: this will be the best interpretation that you can attain to. Seest thou not, that they who think to believe in what hath been inspired into thee, and what hath been inspired into thy Predecessors, incline to dispute before Ta^o^? Neverthelesse, they have commanded not to believe in that Idoll; the Devill laboureth to seduce, and withdraw them from the Truth. When it was said to them. Obey the Commandement of God, and his Prophet, they departed from thee: What will they doe, when there shall happen to them any punishment of their past sinnes? They will return to thee, a^d swear by the name of God, That they desire Peace, and to do good Works; but God knoweth what is in their hearts, and hath abandoned them. Cease not to preach to them, and to declare to them the Word of God; the Prophets, and Apostles were not sent, but to preach, and to be heard through the permission of his Divine goodness. If, when they have hurt their souls, they come to thee, and demand pardon of God, thou shalt beg pardon for  them, they shall find God gracious and mercifull: Th^ will not believe in his divine Maiesty, untill they ha^^ disputed the difference with thee, that is among them and when they shall no more doubt of what thou sha^^ have done, they will without contradiction obey the^ We have ordained them to kill each other, and to fo^sake their houses; they have not done it, except very fe^ of them: and although they did it, they did it not, to obey what should have been to them a great benefit, an^ an exceeding merit; we had given them a very gre^^ reward, and guided them to the right way. He that sha^ obey God, and his Prophet, shall be with them who^ God hath endued with his Grace; He that knoweth it, resigneth himself to his divine Maiesty. O you that are True-believers! be upon your guard, assembled to fight stoutly for the Law of God. There be among you that be cowardly, when any discomfiture hath befaln you; they have said, God protected me, that I was not with them: And when God gave you victory, they spak as if there had been no understanding between them, and you. Would to God, I had been with them I should have acquired exceeding great merit. Fight for the glory of God, against them that prefer the life of this world, to that of Heaven: I will give an exceeding great reward to such as shall fight, that shall be victorious, and to them that shall be slain, fighting for the Faith. Wherefore fight you not for the Law of God? for the liberty of women and children,This place is Mecca. weak and afflicted, that cry, Lord deliver us out of this place; the people thereof are uniust, give us a protector, give us an assured refuge. They that believe in God fight for his Law, and Infidels fight for the Divell. Fight against them that serve the Devill, his policies are weake. Consider those to whom it was said, C^ase to imbr^w your hands in the blood of Infidels, persevere in your prayers, and pay tithes. When they were commanded to fight, part of them were afraid of the multitude, as of God, yea, more afraid of the multitude then of God, and said, Lord thou hast not enioyned us to fight, unlesse thou hast differed us to a neare end. Say to t^^m, The wealt^ of the earth is but a small thing, there  (...) great riches in the other world, for him that shall have ^e feare of God before his eyes. No iniustice shall bee ^ne to you; wheresoever you are, death will meet you, ^^twithstanding you may be in strong Citadels. If good ^^ppen to the Infidels, they say it proceedeth from God; ^evill befall them, they say that cometh from thee. Say (...) them, All proceedeth from God, what then is the will ^f those men? they cannot comprehend this discourse: ^he good that happeneth to you, cometh from God, and ^he evill that befalleth you, is of your selves. We have ^ent thee to the people, to teach them the mysteries of my Law; it is sufficient that I am witnesse. He that obeyeth the Prophet, the Apostle of God, obeyeth God; if they be disobedient, thou art not sent to be their tutor. They say, They will obey thee, and when they are gone from thee, many of them ponder in their heart other things then they have spoken, but God shall write their thoughts, and abandon them. Resigne thy selfe to God, and bee content that he is thy protector. Will they not meditate on the Alcoran? Were it sent from any but from God, there would be therein many contradictions. When they had any assurance of victory, or feared to be overcome, they published it, although they had referred all to the Prophet to the most knowing among them, and to them that obeyed the Prophet, who knew what ought to be published, and what to be kept secret. If the grace of God had not bin with you, and his mercy, you had followed the Devill. Fight for the Law of God, employ but thy person, and be not troubled, if the true believers be without armes,See Kitab el tenoir. the misery of the wicked shall never end, God shall augment their calamity, and encrease the punishment of their crimes; he that doth well, shall find well,This is the ^attell of Beder; the enemies of Mahomet made two battels. and who doth evill, shall find evill, God regardeth all. When you are saluted, returne the salute with honour and affection, God putteth all in accompt. God! there is but one only God, he shall assemble you all at the day of Iudgement, of that there is no doubt. Who is more true in his words then God?

Had it pleased God, he had given th^ advantage over you, and they had beaten you, if they ^^part from you, and follow your Religion, God perm^teth not you to doe them iniury. You shall find some th^^ shall incline to believe you, and their companions, th^^ will turne all to confusion, and fall into it themselves: ^ they separate themselves from you, if they desire not pea^^ of you, and desist not to doe you mischiefe, take and k^^ them, where you find them, we have given you absolu^^ power over them. One true believer ought not to slay another true believer, unlesse it be through ignorance; H^ that shall slay a true believer through ignorance, shal^ redeeme from slavery a true believer, or shall pay damages and interests to the kindred and Heirs of the dead, if they through curtesie discharge him not of them: If he be of your enemies, and a true believer, he shall ransome from captivity a true believer; If he be of your confederates, he shall pay damages and interests to the kindred, and heires of the dead, and redeeme from captivity a true believer; If hee shall bee destitute of means to performe this, he shall fast two months together for a penance appointed of God; God knoweth all things, and is prudent in what he commandeth. He that shall kill a true believer of deliberate purpose, shall be chastised in the fire of Hell, the wrath of God, and his curse shall be upon him eternally. Oh ye! who are true believers, when you fight against Infidels for the Law of God, cause your selves to be known, and say not to them that salute you, thou art not a true believer; If you desire the good things of the world, God possesseth riches innumerable, you were  before like to them, but God hath given you grace, and ^^eth all your actions. The faithfull that continue in ^^eir houses without sicknesse, are not equall in merits (...) such as employ their persons and faculties for the Law (...) God; he preferreth by many degrees, them that fight ^r his Law, and employ their wealth and persons for ^is service; to those that remaine idle in their houses he ^s their protector, and hath prepared for them a sure re^uge in Paradise: he gratifieth by many degrees of fa^our, them that fight for his Law, above those that live ^t ease in their houses, he is gracious and mercifull. The Angels said to the Infidels that they put to death, where were you with your Religion? they answered, we were weak and impotent in the Citie of Mecca; they said, was not the Earth large enough for you to depart from the wicked? Hell shall be their habitation, except the women and children that were weak and impotent; peradven^ure God will pardon them, he is gracious and mercifull; he that shall depart from the wicked to follow his Law, shall find many places favourable to him, assuredly hee will recompense him that shall quit his house, that shall be slaine for his glory, and to follow his Prophet, he is gracious and mercifull. When you shall be in a journey, you shall not offend God to abridge your prayers, that the Infidels may not surprise you, they are your declared Enemies; when thou shalt be neare them, and shalt appoint the true believers to make their prayers, keep about thee a partie of them for a guard, while the residue make their prayers; having finished their Orisons, they shall doe as the first; take armes, and keep a guard, during the time their companions shall make their prayers: the Infidels desire that you quit your armes to surprize you; you shall not doe amisse to quit them, if raine trouble you, or you be sick, but continue alwayes upon your guard, God hath prepared for Infidels ignominious torments: Having finished your prayers, Remember God, standing, sitting or lying downe, and pray when you shall be in a place of safety; prayer is commanded the faithfull in a prefixed and appointed time. Bee not negligent to  pursue the Infidels, if you suffer, they shall suffer (...) you; but you hope for that which they must not hope for God knoweth all their actions, hee is most prudent (...) all his works.

He that demandeth succours of the devill, is in manifest perdition, he will promise to men long life, and retard their repentance, but he promiseth them but a vain glory; hell is the dwelling place of such men, out of which they shall find no issue; Such as shall believe in God, and do good works, shall dwell eternally in Paradise, where flow many rivers. God is most true in what he promiseth, who is more then God in his words? Your lies, and the lies of them that know the written Law, do him no harm;See Gelaldin. be that shall do ill, shall be punished, and shall find no protector; he that shall do well,See Kitab el tenoir. and shall believe in the Law of God, shall enter into Paradise, and shall have no iniustice done to him; what better law is there, then to resigne thy self to God, and to be an honest man? Follow the Law of Abraham; God chose Abraham, to love him; whatsoever is in heaven and in earth, belongeth to his divine Maiesty, he knoweth all things. They will question thee concerning women; say to them, God teacheth you in that, what you were taught in the Scripture touching Orphans, and women; give to them what is appointed by the Law, and desire not to espouse them, only to possess their wealth; God teacheth you likewise to give to Orphans what appertaineth to them, and not to iniure them; he will understand your good actions. If a woman fear to be illentreated by her husband, and that he will divorce her, they shall do well, mutually to accord, for peace is exceeding good. If you be too obstinate, and cannot agree together; if you do good to your wives in divorcing them, and feare to wrong them, God will take notice of your actions. If you believe you cannot keep equality, and iustice among your wives, although you apply your selves to it; Incline not altogether to your own appetites, and leave not your wife, as a thing left in toleration. If you live in a good accord and fear to injure them, God will be mercifull to  you. If they separate themselves conformably to the precepts of the Law, God will enrich them with his protection, he is bountifull and wise, and whatever is in Heaven, and Earth obeyeth him. We have recommended to you the fear of God, as we have heretofore, to them that had knowledge of the written Law. If you be impious, know, that whatever is in Heaven and Earth is Gods; he hath no need of his creatures, must be exalted, it sufficeth thee, he is thy protector. If he will, he can cause you to perish, and put other creatures in your place, for he is Omnipotent. He that loveth the good things of the Earth, shall find in God all the wealth of this world, and of the other, he understandeth and seeth all things. Oh you that believe! be true in your testimonies, notwithstanding it be against your selves, against your Father and Mother, and against your kindred, and consider the rich no more then the poore, God is the protector of the one, and the other; follow not your appetites, to favour the rich more then the poore, pervert not the Truth, be not sc^^pulous to testifie what you know, God knoweth all your actions. Oh ye that believe in God! and his Prophet, and the Book that was sent before him; know, he that blasphemeth against his divine Majestie, against his Angels, the Scripture, the Prophets, and life eternall, greatly erreth, and departeth from the Truth. God pardoneth not them that have embraced his Law, and then have forsaken it, having believed in his divine Majestie, and are returned again to their impietie; declare to such men, they shall feel heavie torments. Such as obey Infidels, to be great in this world, extreamly delude themselves; greatness proceedeth from God; It is written in the Book that was sent to you, that the Infidels shall mock you, when they shall hear the word of God, and you shall obey his Commandements; Tarry not in their company, if they change not their discourse, otherwise you will be like to them, God will assemble into the fire of Hell all Infidels, and wicked persons. Some of them that observe your actions, said, they were of your partie, when any felicitie hapned to you; and when the Infidels had advantage  over you, they said, they were with them, and that they fought against you; God at the day of judgement shall judge the difference that is between you, and will not give advantage to Infidels, over them that observe his Law. The wicked thinke to deceive God, but God deceiveth them, they are negligent to make their prayers, they are hypocrites before the world, and remember not his divine Majestie, except very few of them, uncertain whether they should follow the faithfull, or the Infidels; hee whom God shall cause to goe astray, shall not find the right way. Oh ye that believe! obey not Infidels, to the exclusion of true believers; will you give God manifest occasion to chastise you for your sinnes? The wicked shall be in the lowest place of Hell, and shall find no relief, except such as shall repent, that shall do good works, resigne themselves to God, and obey his Commandements, they shall be with the true believers, and receive from God a very great reward. He will not send you miserie, if you give him thanks for his favours, and obey him; he accepteth the acknowledgement of his benefits, and knoweth all things. He willeth not that what evill is committed, be published; he that publisheth the evill he doth, is very much to blame; if you manifest the good you do, or if you conceale it, and abstain from doing evill, he will be mercifull to you, he is omnipotent. Such as blaspheme against God and his Prophets, his Apostles; such as would make a distinction between the Commandements of his divine Majestie, and the precepts of his Prophets, such as affirme they believe in some of the Prophets, and believe not in all, and take a middle way betweene faith and impietie, are indeed impious, we have prepared for them ignominious torments; but they who believe in God, and generally in all his Prophets, and Apostles, shall be recompenced of God, gracious and mercifull. They that know the written Law, will require thee to cause to d^scend from Heaven a Book, and written Tables; They demanded of Moses greater things, and said,The Iews. Cause us to behold God with our eyes, then thunder surprized them  by reason of their impiety: They adored the Calfe, after having had the knowledge of our Commandements; neverthelesse, we pardoned them, and gave to Moses an absolute dominion over them. We raised the Mountain over them, following our promises, anh said to them; Enter the gate of the Temple with adoration and humility, and no longer transgress the observation of the day of Rest; We for this matter received from them a strong promise, but they swarved from what they had promised, and we cursed them, because of their impietie, by reason of the murther they committed-without reason, on the persons of the Prophets, and of the words they uttered, viz. Our heart is hardned; Contrariwise, God imprinted infidelitie in their hearts, they shall never believe in his Law, except very few of them, because of their malice, and the blasphemies they vomited against Mary: they said,The Christians. We have slain the Messiah, Jesus, the Son of Mary, the Prophet and Apostle of God: Certainly they flew him not, neither crucified him, they crucified one among them that resembled him; such as doubt it are in a manifest error, and speak not but through opinion. Certainly they flew him not; on the contrary, God took him up to himself, he is Omnipotent and prudent in all his actions: Such as have the knowledge of Scripture, ought to believe in Jesus before his death, he shall be a witnesse against them of their actions at the day of Judgement; We have prohibited them that Judaize, by reason of their sin, things that were permitted them; We have prepared for them great torment, because they mislead the world from the right way, because they take Use that is forbidden them, and unjustly eat the substance of their neighbour. Such of them as are profound in Learning, and all the faithfull, believe in the Scriptures, both ancient, and modern; I will give great rewards to them that shall make their prayers at the time appointed, that shall pay Tithes, and believe in the day of Judgement. We have sent thee our inspirations, as we sent them to Noah, and the Prophets after him; as we heretofore sent them to Abraham, Ismael, Isaac, Iacob, the Tribes, to Jesus, Iob,  Ionas, Aaron, and to Solomon, and gave the Psalter to David, We have told thee who were the Prophets that preceded thee; but we have not spoken to thee, concerning the merits of all them. Moses spake to God, as his Prophet, and Apostle; all declared his mercy, and preached the torments of Hell, to the end men might have no cause of excuse; God is Omnipotent and prudent in all his actions: He shall be witnesse that the Alcoran was sent to thee with his Commandements, the Angels likewise testifie it; but it ought to suffice thee, that God is witness. The Infidels that hindred the people to follow the Law of God, were exceedingly erroneous; God will not pardon them, he will lead them into the path of Hell, where they shall remain eternally, it is a thing easie to his divine Majestie. Oh people? A Prophet is come to you, who preacheth to you the Truth from the Lord, believe him, you shall do well; if you believe him not, know, that whatever is in Earth, and in Heaven is Gods, and that God knoweth whatsoever you do. Oh ye that understand the written Law! Obey the Commandements of God, and speak not of his divine Majestie but with truth; the Messiah, Jesus, the Son of Mary, is a Prophet, and an Apostle of God, his Word, and his Spirit, which he sent to Mary; believe therefore in God, and in his Prophets, and say not there be three Gods, put an end to that discourse, you shall do well; For there is but one God, praysed be God, he hath no Son; what-ever is in Heaven, and in Earth obeyeth him, it is sufficient that he is witnesse. The Messiah esteemeth it no dishonour to be the servant of God, neither the Angel, nor the Cherubins, He that holdeth it a dishonour to be at his service, is too proud; he shall assemble all the world at the day of Judgement, and every one shall receive the recompence that he shall have merited, he shall augment his favours upon them that shall have believed in his divine Majestie, and have done good works; he shall chastise them that shall have held it a dishonour to be his servants, and have been proud upon the Earth, they shall find no safe refuge but in his mercy. Oh people! God hath sent you a Protector, a most strong  argument, and a most cleare light; they that shall trust in God, shall enjoy his grace, and he shall guide them into the right way. They will enquire of thee concerning successions; say to them, God teacheth you touching successions, as followeth; If a man decease without issue, and hath a sister, she shall have the moity of what he shall leave, and shall inherit it, if she have no children: If they be two sisters, they shall have two thirds of what the deceased left; if they be many brothers, and many sisters, the Sonne shall have as much as two daughters; God teacheth you his Commandemements, depart not from the right way, he is Omniscient.   CHAP. V. The Chapter of the Table, containing an hundred and twenty verses, written at Medina. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. O ye that believe in God! Satisfie what you have promised; it is permitted you to eat of the beasts that be in the world, except of what shall be hereafter declared. Hunting is forbidden you, during the time that you shall goe on Pilgrimage to Mecca. God ordaineth what he will. O ye that believe! say not, That it is permitted to doe what God hath prohibited, performe what is commanded you, during the month of Pilgrimage; give no impediment to such as carry presents to Mecca, n^ither to them that assume The old Arabians in devotion, p^t the leaves and b^a^^^es of Trees upon their necks, like collers, as the Peasa^ts in many places in France do the herbs of S^. John. Collers, neither hinder Pilgrims to repaire thither, to demand the Grace of God, and his mercies. It is lawfull for you to hunt, when you shall have finished your pilgrimage; beware lest some pesons cause you to sin, and hinder your going to Mecca; to oblige you to punish them, repose your confidence in the justice and feare of God, and not in the sin and malice of your neighbour. Feare God who is severe in his chastisements. It is forbidden you to eat Carrion,See Kitab el tenoir. Blood, Swines flesh, and whatsoever is not killed in pronounc^ng the name of God: you are  prohibited to eat Animals strangled, choakt, knockt down, precipitated, that are slain striking each other, and such as beasts shall have slain; if you find them not alive, to let out their blood, in pronouncing the name of God. You shall not eat of beasts sacrificed to Idols: Consult not with Southsayers or Lots, it is a great sin. The day shall come when they that have abandoned your Law,See Gelaldin. shall be desperate; feare not them, and feare me: The day will come, when I shall accomplish your Law, and my grace shall be abundantly upon you: The Law of Salvation, is the Law that I desire to give you. If any one be in necessity, and eateth of what is prohibited, without a will to sin, God shall be to him gracious and mercifull. They will demand of thee, what is permitted them to eat? Say to them it is lawfull to eat all sorts of beasts that are not uncleane, and whatever hath been taught you from God, touching beasts that hath been wounded by Lions or Dogs, eat the beast you shall take, and remember God in blooding them; feare God, he is exact to take account. This day it is lawfull that you eat what is not uncleane, and the meats of them that know the written Law,The Jewes and Christians. their meats are lawfull for you, and yours for them. You are permitted to espouse maidens and women of free condition, that are of your Religion, and maidens and women of free condition, that know the written Law, giving them their dowry with civility; commit neither Concubinage, nor Adultery with them, neither secretly or publiquely; the good works of him that shall renounce your Law, shall be unprofitable, he shall be at the day of Judgment in the number of the damned. O ye that believe in God, when you would make your prayers, wash your faces, your hands to the elbow, and passe your hand over your head, and over your feet to the ancles. If you be polluted, purifie your selves; if sick, or in a journey, or about to discharge your belly, or have knowne women, and find no water to wash you, lay hand on the sand, passe it over your visage, and wipe therewith your hands. God enjoyneth you nothing irksome, but willeth you be cleane, and desireth to accomplish his grace upon you; peradventure  you will give him thanks. O yee that believe in God! call to mind his grace, and promise he made to you, when you said, We heard, and obeyed, feare him, he knoweth all that is in your hearts. O ye that believe in God! obey his Commandements, and be true in your Testimonies, take heed that no man move you to offend God, in divert^ng you from what is just; render justice to all, his feare inviteth you to it; have it before your eyes, hee knoweth all your actions; hath promised his grace, and great recompenses to the True believers, that shall doe good works in this world, and hath prepared Hell to punish Infidels. O ye that believe in God! remember his favour towards you, when some persons would have extended their hands upon you, and how he delivered you from their malice;Corcis Enemie to Mahomet. Feare him, all true believers ought to resigne themselves to his will. God received the promise of the Children of Israel to observe his Commandemements, he established among them twelve Captains, and said to them, I will be with you when you shall make prayers, pay your Tithes, believe in the Prophets, defend them, and shall lend to me any almes; I will cover your sinnes, and cause you enter Paradise, wherein flow many rivers; and he among you that shall be an Infidell, shall bee entirely erroneous from the right path. When they swarved from what they had promised, we gave them our curse, and hardned their heart; they have altered the words of the Scripture, and abjured what they had approved. Thou shalt not know them that shall bee Traitors, except very few of them; forgive and depart from them, God loveth them that doe good. We likewise received the promise of those who call themselves Christians, but they have forgotten what they promised; they have altered what was taught them, and we have cast among them enmitie and hatred, even untill the day of Judgement. That day God shal cause them to know what ever they had done for their punishment. O yee that know the written Law! our Mahom^t. Prophet is come to bring to light many things of the Scripture, which you conceale, and he likewise leaveth in silence many things, that it is not time to make  manifest. God hath sent you a Book full of light, to conduct into the way of Salvation them that love him, to bring them out of darknesse, and by his speciall grace, to lead them into the way of Salvation. Certainly he that saith, that the Messiah, the Sonne of Mary, is God, is impious: Say to him who can hinder God to exterminate the Messiah, and his Mother, with whatsoever is in the Earth, when it shall seeme good to him? God is King of Heaven and earth, he created with them what seemed good to him, he is Omnipotent. The Jews and Christians have said, we are the Children of God, his wel-beloved; Say to them, shall not God chastise you for your sinnes? Certainly ye are men; He that created you, pardoneth, and punisheth as it pleaseth him, he is the King of all that is in Heaven or Earth, and of whatever is betweene them, he is the refuge of the righteous. O ye that have knowledge in the written Law! The Poophet, the Apostle of God is come to instruct you in a time that there is none other Prophet but hee on the Earth; Will you say that no man preached to you the torments of Hell? Certainly the word of God is this day preached to you, the torment of Hell, and the Omnipotencie of his Divine Majestie. Remember thou what Moses said to his people, Oh people, call to mind the grace of God towards you, he hath chosen from among you Prophets, and Kings, hath conferred on you what he hath given to none in the world: Enter into the holy Land, as God hath commanded, turne not your backs to your enemies, lest you be in the number of Reprobates: They answered, oh Moses! there are Gyants and Tyrants in the Holy Land, we will not enter into it, untill they be gone out of it, if they forsake it, we will enter into it. Then two men of them that were in the grace of God, said to them, enter at the gate, and fight against them, you shall be victorious, trust in God, if you believe in his Law: They said, oh Moses! we will not enter, so long as those Tyrants dwell therein, goe and fight against them with thy Lord, we will here attend. Then said Moses, Lord, I dispose but of mine own, and my brothers person; separate us from this wicked  people; the Lord said to him, the entrance into the Holy Land is prohibited to this people, they shall wander forty years upon the Earth, in confusion and amazement, afflict not thy selfe with the deportments of the wicked; teach them the Historie of the Sonnes of Adam, how they offered sacrifices, how the sacrifice of the one was accepted that of the other was not: he through envie menaced his brother, to murther him; his brother said to him, God receiveth the sacrifices, and holocausts of such as have his feare before their eyes: assuredly if thou extendest thine hand to slay me, I will not stretch forth mine to hurt thee; I feare the Lord of the Universe; If thou chargest thy selfe with the murther of my person, with thy past sinnes, thou shalt goe to hell, where the unjust shall be punished: The murther of his brother seemed easie and advantagious for him, he slew him, and is in the number of the Damned. God sent a Raven that made a pit in the Earth, and shewed him the manner to bury the body of his brother: Then said he, would to God I had been weake and impotent, that I were like to this Raven? I must bury the body of my brother, and he was penitent for his offence; by reason of this murther, we ordained to the children of Israel, that he who shall slay a person innocent, shall be punished, as if he had slaine the whole world, and he that shall give him his life, shall be recompensed, as if hee had given life to the whole world. My Prophets came to the Children of Israel, taught them my Commandements, and caused them to see Miracles, neverthelesse many of them were disobedient? the punishment of them that oppose the will of God, that of his Prophet, and that endeavour to pollute the earth, is to be slain, hanged, to have the right foot, and the left hand, or right hand, and the left foot cut off, and to bee extirpated from the earth; they shall have in this world shame on the forehead, and shall feele in the other, great torments, except such as shall be converted before their death, and shall know, that God is gracious and mercifull. Oh ye that believe! feare God, fight for his Law, you perhaps shall be happy. All the Treasures of the world  shall not bee able to redeeme Infidels at the day of Judgement, they shall endure exceeding great torments, they shall desire to goe out of the fire of Hell, but shall dwell there eternally. Cut off the hands of those men and women that steale, they contract upon themselves the wrath of the world, and the punishment that God hath prepared for the wicked: He that shall turn, and do good works, shall be pardoned, God is gracious and mercifull to the penitent. Knowest thou not that the Kingdome of Heaven, and of Earth is Gods? that hee chastiseth and pardoneth whom it pleaseth him? and that he is Omnipotent? Oh Prophet! afflict not thy selfe, to behold them running to impietie; that say with the mouth, we believe, and have no faith in their hearts; neither for them that Judaize, and hearken to the lies of their Doctors, to relate them to others; they pervert the language of the Old Testament, and say; If you be instructed in those precepts, you ought to observe them, if they instruct you not in them, take heed to your selves. Such as make use of the name of God, to move the people to sedition, are without faith, God will not purifie their hearts, they shall have in this world shame upon the forehead, and feele in the other extreame torments. They listen to blasphemies, and eat what is prohibited; If they repaire to thee, and submit themselves to thy judgement, judge their controversie with equity, converse not with them; if thou depart from their company, they shall not hurt thee, if thou givest judgement between them, Judge with equitie, God loveth the just: How shall they submit to thy judgement, seeing they have the Old Testament, which containeth the Commandements of God? They will not execute thy Judgement, neither believe in the Old Testament, whereis the guide of the right way, and a light to the Prophets, to judge the differences arising among true believers, among Jews; their Doctors, and ther Priests, who study the Scripture, and are witnesses that it containeth the truth, feare not the world, but dread me; sell not, neither exchange my commandements for any price. Such as judge not conformably to the Law of God, are Infidels;  We have ordained the Talio, man for man, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an eare for an eare, a tooth for a tooth, a wound for a wound; he that shall observe it, shall do well, and such as shall not judge conformably to the Law of God are unjust. We sent after many Prophets, Jesus the Son of Mary, who confirmed the ancient Scriptures, to him we gave the Gospel, full of light, to conduct the people to the right way, with a confirmation of the Old Testament, a guide and instruction for the righteous. They that follow the Gospel, ought to judge as it is commanded in the Gospel; such as judge not conformably to what God hath taught them, are disobedient to his divine Majesty. To thee have we sent the Book that containeth the truth, and confirmeth the antient Scriptures, determine the differences that shall arise among the people, as I have inspired thee, and follow not the appetite of men that will abjure the truth which I have taught thee. We have instructed all of you in a Law, and assured means to lead you into the way of Salvation; you should all have been of one and the same Religion, had it so pleased God; he hath done this to prove you; Doe good, and know, that you all shall be assembled before him, and he shall resolve the doubts that are among you. If thou judgest the differences that are among them, judge comformably to what hath been inspir^d into thee, and follow not their appetites; be carefull they seduce thee not, and move thee to doubt many things that God hath taught thee; if they disobey his Commandements, know, he will severely punish them, because of the enormity of their crimes. The greatest part of the world are impious; Do they affect the Judgement of the Ignorant? What better Judge for the good, is there then God? O ye that believe! obey not the Jews, nor the Christians, they mutually obey each other in their impietie, he that shall obey them, shall be like unto them, God guideth not the unjust. Thou seest such as are unstable in their Faith, flock to them, and say, they fear a change of times, but God shall give advantage and victory to his Prophet, and they shall repent to have concealed in their mindes the Miracles of his divine Majestie.  What will they alleadge for excuse, who swore by the name of God, exactly to observe their Religion, and to be with you? Their good works shall be unprofitable, and they in the number of the Damned. Oh ye that believe! if you abandon your faith, God will put others in your place, that shall love him, and he them, and this to your great ignominie, and the advantage of converted Infidels, that shall fight without fear, for his Law: Thus God bestoweth his grace, as he seeth good, he is liberall, and Omniscient. You ought certainly to obey God,See Gelaldin. and his Prophet, his Apostle; they who believe in God, that make their prayers at the time appointed, pay tithes, and are in the protection of God and his Prophet, shall be beloved of his divine Majestie, and be victorious. Oh ye true believers! obey not such as scoffe at your Religion, who have knowledge of the written Law; obey not Infidels, and if you are good men, fear God; obey not them that deride your prayers, it is the action of those that are unwise. Oh ye that understand the written Law! will you not abhorre me, if I believe not in God, in what he hath inspired into me, and into them that preceded me? The greatest part of you are wicked. Say to them, Did I instruct you to do evill, when I preached to you the effect of Gods mercy? Those whom he curseth, against whom he is incensed, whom he hath metamorphised into Apes, and Swine, and who have adored Idols, shall be confined in the fire of Hell, they are in a very evill way. When they come to thee, they will say, they believe in the Law of God, they will enter thine house with impiety, and goe forth in the like manner, but God knoweth what they conceale in their heart: Thou shalt see many of them embrace Paganisme, follow a lye, eat what is forbidden, and this to displease their Doctors, and Priests, who have forbidden them to speak lies, and eat meats that are unclean. The Jews said, the hand of God is shut, contrariwise, it is their hand that is shut, and they shall be accursed by reason of their discourse: certainly the hands of God are open, and he doth good to whom he pleaseth: Many amongst them, through impietie, and disobedience, alter  what is in the Scripture; but we have cast among them hatred, and horror, even to the day of Judgement, God hath extinguished the fire which they had kindled, to make warre against the righteous; they endeavour to pollute the earth, but God detesteth such as cause disorder; he remitteth their sinnes that know the Scripture, believe in his Law, and flie impiety, they shall enter Paradise, that is full of delights. They have read the Old Testament, the Gospel, and all Scriptures, they enjoyed abundance of all good things; neverthelesse many have disobeyed the Commandements of God. Oh Prophet! preach what God hath taught thee; whether thou dost preach it, or doest not, he will defend thee from the malice of men, he abhorreth Infidels. Oh ye that know the written Law! if you observe not the Old Testament, the Gospel, and Scriptures which God hath sent you, you shall be without merit. Many of them through impiety and ignorance, pervert what is contained in the Scripture; afflict not thy self with the actions of the impious. The Jews, Samaritans, Christians, all that shall have believed in God, the Resurrection of the dead, and have done good works, shall be exempt from affliction, there is nothing for them to feare at the day of Judgement.See Kitab el tenoir. We received of the Children of Israel a promise, to believe in our Prophets, and Apostles; Yet have they slandred many, and slain such as would not follow their appetites: they believed there was no punishment for their crimes, and became deafe, and blinde; After this, God pardoned them, neverthelesse, they returned in their sin, and are again become deaf, and blinde; God beholdeth all their deportments. Certainly, they who affirme the Messiah, the Son of Mary, to be God, are impious; the Messiah commanded the Children of Israel to worship God, his and their Lord; the entrance into Paradise is forbidden to him that shall say, God hath a companion equall to him, Hell shall be his habitation, and the unjust shall finde none to protect them at the day of Judgement. Such as affirm there are three Gods, are impious: there is but one God; if they defist not from such discourse, they shall  burn in the fire of Hell; if they turn, and implore pardon of God, he will be to them gracious and mercifull. The Messiah, the Son of Mary, is a Prophet, and Apostle of God, like to the Prophets that came before him; his Mother is holy, and both of them did eat and drink. Consider how I manifiest my unitie to Infidels; how they blaspheme, and depart from the Truth; say to them, Will you worship in stead of God, what can neither benefit, nor hurt you? God understandeth and knoweth all things. O ye that have knowledge of the written Law! speak of your Religion with reverence, and follow not the appetites of such as go astray, and walk in an evill way. The Infidels were accursed by the tongue of David, and of Messiah, the Son of Mary, because of their disobedience; they abstain not from things that are not approved; they do them, and through obstinacy will continue them. Thou shalt see many of the Inhabitants of Mecca adhere to them, by reason of the sin they conceale in their hearts. God assuredly will be incensed against them, and they shall be confined eternally in the torments of Hell. If they had believed in God, in his Prophet, and the Scriptures, they had not obeyed Infidels, but many of them are impious. Thou shalt finde the Jews, and Inhabitants of Mecca, who believe in many Gods, to be very great enemies to the faithfull, and the Christians to have a great inclination, and amity towards the True-believers; for that they have Priests, and Religious, that are humble, who have eyes full of tears, when they hear mention of the Doctrine which God hath inspired into thee, because of their knowledge of the Truth, and say, Lord, We believe in thy Law, write us in the number of them that profess thy Unity, who hindreth us to believe in God, and the Truth wherein we have been instructed? We desire with passion, O Lord, to be in the number of the jest. God shall hearken to their prayer, and pardon them; he shall open to them the gate of Paradise, wherein is the reward of the righteous, and the Infidels shall inhabit the abyss of Hell. Oh ye who are True-believers! inh^bit not the eating of what God hath permitted, offend not God, hee  abhorreth them that offend him, eat of the meats that are lawfull for you, and have his fear before your eyes, he will not chastise you for what you have spoken at randome, contrary to your faith, without design of offending him, but he shall punish you for your oaths, if you observe them not; the satisfaction of an oath not accomplished, is to give food to ten poore of your Religion, and to cloath them, or to enfranchise a slave that is a True-believer; he that is destitute of means to perform this, shall fast three dayes immediately succeeding, such is the satisfaction of a not-accomplished oath; keep exactly your faith, so doth God teach you his Commandements, you will, peradventure, give him thanks. Oh ye that believe in God! Wine, Games of hazard, Idols, Lots, and divinations are abominations, and filthy practises of the Devill, depart from him, perhaps you will be righteous. The Devill desireth to fow among you dissention, and horrour, through wine, and games of hazard, to choak your remembrance of God, and of praying to him; abandon wine, and games of hazard, be obedient to God, and the Prophet, his Apostle, and take heed to your selves; If you disobey God, know that the Prophet is obliged only to preach publiquely the word of his divine Majesty; the True-believers, and the righteous have not provoked God in drinking wine, and playing at games of hazard, before they were prohibited, they will abstaine for the future, and performe good works, God loveth them that do good. Oh ye that believe! God proveth you by one thing, to wit, by hunting, whether you take the game with your hands, or coursing on horse-back, to discerne them among you that fear him, and believe in his Law; whosoever shall offend him, shall be severely punished. Oh ye that believe! kill not your game, during the time of your pilgrimage to Mecca; whosoever shall kill of deliberate purpose, shall be judged, as if he had slain his Neighbours beast, he shall be judged by one among you, and be condemned to offer a present at the Temple of Mecca, or to give food to the poore, or to fast, or performe somewhat of like nature, for the expiation of his errour; if he have  repentance in his mind, God will pardon what is past; if he returne in his sin, God will be avenged on him, he is omnipotent, and avengfull. It is permitted that you fish, and eat of fish during your Pilgrimage, but hunting by land is absolutely forbidden in this voyage; feare God, you shall all one day be assembled before him to be judged, he hath appointed the month of Pilgrimage, he hath established the Temple of Mecca for the devotion of the people, and hath forbidden to give impediment to such as bring thither oblations, and those that assume The ancient Arabians put upon their necks the leaves of trees, in devotion, when they arrived at Mecca. Collers, to the end, you may learne to understand that he knoweth all things both in Heaven, and Earth, and that he is Omnipotent. Know ye, that he is grievous in his chastisements, and gracious and mercifull: The Prophet is obliged but to preach his Commandements, he knoweth all that you conceale in your hearts, and whatever you make manifest: Evill must not be equall to good, notwithstanding it be pleasing to you: Oh ye that are wise! have the feare of God before your eyes, peradventure you shall be happy. Oh ye believers! desire not the knowledge of all things, you will afflict your selves; be not curious to know at what time the Alcoran was sent from Heaven, God pardoneth your former curiosity;See Kitab el tenoir. your Predecessours were alike curious, and in the number of unbelievers God hath commanded nothing touching These are the Ceremonies of the ancient Arabians, which Mahomet renounceth. the she Camell, whose eare is slit, neither that which is at liberty in the field, neither concerning the Ewe that hath brought forth seven Lambs, neither the Camell, of whom have issued ten Camels, but the wicked invent blasphemies against his divine Majestie, and are unwise; When it was said to them come, and observe what God hath taught his Prophet, they replyed, it sufficed them to follow what their fathers had observed, notwithstanding their fathers were ignorant and erroneous. Oh ye believers!See Kitab el tenoir. be carefull of your selves, such as be in errour shall not hurt you; if you follow the right way, all of you shall one day be assembled before God, who shall discover all your works, and reward you according to your merits. Oh ye believers! make your Testament, when your death  approacheth, and take two witnesses of your own Religion, that are honest men; If you are in a journey, and sicknesse surprize you, you shall take two witnesses, such as you shall meet with, to serve your testament, and having prayed, shall deliver to them your will. If you doubt their integrity, cause them sweare to be faithfull in their testimonies, and not give themselves to be corrupted by your kindred. Conceale not your testimony, lest you be in the number of sinners. If you discover those two witnesses to have erred in their testimonie, substitute two other in their place, although they partake in your succession, and take oath of them to be more veritable in their dispositions, then the two others, otherwise they will offend God, and be numbred with the unjust. It is better to speake Truth, then to be in feare, lest your falshood be detected; feare God, and hearken to his Commandements, he guideth not them that disobey him. He shall one day assemble his Prophets and Apostles, and say unto them, what did you answer, being questioned concerning my unity? they shall reply, Lord, we are ignorant, thou alone knowest all things. He shall say to Jesus, Oh Jesus, Sonne of Mary, remember thou my grace towards thee, and thy mother, I strengthned thee with the Holy Ghost; Thou spakest in thy Cradle, as a man of forty or fifty yeares, thee did I instruct in Scripture and knowledge, the Old Testament, and the Gospell; Thou didst forme of earth the figure of a Bird, didst breath upon it, and it did flie, thou didst cure the borne-blind, and the leprous, didst revive the dead, I delivered thee from the Jews, when thou didst preach to them my Commandements, and wroughtest miracles, which the wicked affirmed to be magick, and inchantment. Remember, how thou didst command thy Apostles to believe in me, and obey my Prophet, and how they said, we believe in one sole God, be thou witnesse that we entirely resign our selves to the will of God. Remember Mahomet. thou, that the Apostles said, Oh Jesus, Son of Mary, can thy Lord send us from Heaven a Table covered with meats to satisfie us? Jesus answered them, Fear God, if you believe in his Law; they said, we have an  appetite, and desire to eat of the food of Heaven, for the repose of our hearts, and to know if thou speakest the truth, of which we shall be witnesses. Then said he, Oh God my Lord, cause to descend upon us from Heaven a Table covered with meat, this day shall be celebrated by us and them that shall succeed, this shall be a signe of thy omnipotency; enrich us with thy grace, thou possessest all treasure. God said to him, I will cause to descend from Heaven the food which thou desirest, and whosoever shall be impious, shall be punished with torments, that no man yet hath suffered. He shal say at the day of ^udgment, oh Jesus, Sonne of Mary! didst thou enjoyne the people to worship thee, and thy mother, as two Gods? Jesus shall answer, praised be thy name; I will take heed of speaking what is not, thou knowest if I have said it, thou art omniscient, thou knowest what is in my soul, and I have no knowledge of what is in thee; I delivered nothing but what thou didst command me to speake: to wit, Worship God your Lord, and mine, I am witnesse from the time that I was in the world, untill thou didst cause me to dye; thou didst observe the deportments of the people, thou seest all; if thou chastisest men, they are thy Creatures; if thou dost pardon them, thou art omnipotent and wise. Then shall God say, this day shall good workes be profitable to the righteous, they shall enter into Paradise, wherein flow many rivers, there shall they dwell eternally, with my grace, in exceeding great felicitie; the Kingdome of Heaven, of Earth is Gods, he is Omnipotent.   CHAP. VI. The Chapter of Gratifications,Gelaldin justifieth this Chapter of Animals. containing one hundred and seventy five Verses, written at Medina. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull: Praise bee to God the Creator of Heaven, of Earth, of darkenesse, and of light; such as believe not in their Lord are in error.See Gelaldin. He it is that created you of the dust of the Earth, and appointed  a prefixed time for your death, and resurrection; neverthelesse you doubt, he is God in Heaven and in Earth, he understandeth the secrets of your hearts, and whatsoever you make manifest; he knoweth the good and evil that you commit, that his Commandements have been taught the Inhabitants of Mecca, and that they have abjured them; they opposed the revealed Truth, but shall be chastised for their contempt, They consider not how much people we have destroyed, in past ages; we gave them places to dwell in,See Gelaldin. more strong and spacious then those which you inhabit, sent them about of raine, caused fountaines flow in the places of their habitation; after this did we extirpate them, by reason of their sins, and established in their place a new people. We have sent to thee the Scripture, written in Vellam, the unbelievers have handled it with their hands, yet say, it is evident sorcery and enchantment, that they will not believe therein, unless they see an Angel descend, to confirme it. Should we have sent an Angel, they had perished by his presence, unless we had sent him under the Figure of a man, like unto them, and cloathed as they are. They derided the Prophets, and Apostles, thy Predecessors; derision is fallen upon such as contemned them. Say to them, goe through the world, and consider the end of them that abjure the Law of God; say to them, to whom appertaineth whatsoever is in Heaven and earth? it is Gods. He will employ his mercy to save you; doubtlesse he will assemble all of you at the day of Judgement. Neverthelesse Infidels believe not in his Unity; they consider not, that whatsoever moveth by night, and by day, and whatsoever is in the world, belongeth to his Divine Majesty, who understandeth and knoweth all things. Say to them, require you other protection then that of God the Omnipotent, Creator of heaven and earth, who nourisheth all things, is nourished by none? Say to them, I have received a command to embrace the Law of Salvation. Be not ye in number of unbelievers; I feare to disobey my Lord, and feare the torments prepared for the wicked at the day of Judgement; he that shall deliver himselfe, shall enjoy the grace of God,  which is supreame felicity: If God will punish you, none shall deliver you from his punishment; if his Will be to doe good to you, he is Omnipotent, alwayes victorious, and hath all power over his Creatures; he is most wise and Omniscient. Say to them, What better testimony is there in the world then that of God? Say to them, He shall testifie between you and me, to whom he hath inspired the Alcoran to instruct you: Will any among you that shall learn it, say there is any other God, but God; I will not say so; there is but one God, and I am innocent from the sin you commit, in associating him with a companion equall to him; many of them that understand the written Law, have knowledge of the truth of the Alcoran; their children also know it, but such as forsake their owne souls, will not believe in God. Who more unjust, then he that blasphemeth against God and his Commandements? Certainly the wicked shall be miserable; I will assemble all of them, and say, where are the gods which you did associate with God? They shall have none other excuse, but to say, by God, Lord, we were of the number of Idolaters. Consider how they will lie, and disavow their blasphemies: some there be among them that hearken to thee, we have hardened their hearts, they will not learne the Alcoran, because their ears are stopped. When they shall heare related all the miracles of the world, and shall see them with their eyes, they will not believe untill they have disputed against thee. The wicked say the Alcoran is but a lie, and Fable of Antiquity; they forbid the people to believe it, and contemne it; certainly they destroy their souls, and know it not; thou shalt see when they shall be detained in the fire of hell, they will say, would to God I might return into the world, I would obey the Commandements of his divine Majesty, and be in the number of true believers. They knew the truth, but conceal'd it; should they return into the world they would return to their impiety, they are liars. They affirm, there is none other life then that of the world, neither any resurrection; when they shall be before God, they shal acknowledge their errors, he shall cause them to feele the  chastisements due to their blasphemies. Such as believe not in the resurrection, are wretched men, they shall be afflicted for their sins at the houre when ever death shall surprize them; they shall bear on their back the burthen of their crimes, and avouch the life of this world to be but deceit and vanity, and the life of the other to be full of felicity for the righteous;O Mahomet. neverthelesse the wicked are not converted. I know thou wilt be incensed against such as shall say, they desire to obey thee, and shall renounce thy Doctrine; they that contemne the Commandements of God are impious, they have belied the Prophets thy Predecessors; the Prophets endured their lies, and were patient, untill we destroyed them; God declineth not what he hath promised. Thou knowest what the Prophets foretold: if men abandon thee, canst thou covet to continue on earth (to instruct them) and to be in heaven at the same time, to cause prodogies appear (testimonies of thy mission.) Had it so pleased God,See Gelaldin. he had brought them all into the right way, nor had they been in the number of the ignorant. Certainly he heareth the prayers of the righteous, that hearken to his word; he will g^ve resurrection to the dead, and assemble them to receive recompence according to their merits. They have said, we believe not in the Prophet, if he shew not to us some miracle from his Lord: say unto them, God hath shewed you many miracles, but most of you doe not understand them; the beasts that walk upon the Earth, and the birds that flie in the Aire, are in the number of h^s cre^tures: We have not omitted to write any thing that is writt^n ^n the Book kept in heaven; all men shall one day appear before God, such as shall not have believed in his Law, shall be deaf and dumb, and inhabit darkenesse: God misleadeth whom it pleaseth him, and guideth in the right way whom he seeth good. Say unto them, have you ^^lt the punishment of God? Have you had knowledge of the day of Judgement? Will you invoke any but God, if you be good men? If you implore him, he will deliver you f^om the evils that you feare; and if it please him, you shall abandon the Idols, which with unbelievers you adore. We sent our Prophets to  them that were before you, when they contemned them, we sent afflictions to procure their conversion, which had not been done without the miseries that we brought upon them. Nevertheles their heart is hardned, the devill caused them to find disobedience more advantagious, and they forgot what was taught them. When we opened the gate of happinesse, they exceedingly rejoyced, and were ingratefull; but when they thought least of it, they were chastised, became desperate, and were extirpated for the great glory of God; Lord of the Univers, say unto them, if God rendred you deaf, blind, and ignorant, what other god then God shall restore your sight, hearing,O Mahomet. and knowledge? Consider how I manifest my Unity; neverthelesse they will not believe it, say unto them, have, you had a sense of the scourge of God secretly and publikely? Hath God condemned any but the wicked? He sent not the Prophets and Apostles, but to proclaime the felicity of Paradise, and preach the torments of Hell: He that shall believe, and doe good works, shall be exempt from feare at the day of Judgement, and unbelievers shall be punished, because of their disobedience: Say unto them, I told you not that I had in my power all the treasures of God, neither that I had knowledge of the future, and past; nor doe afirme, that I am an Angell, I only act what hath been inspired into me; is the blind like to him that seeth clearly? Consider what I say. I preach not the day of Judgement but to such as apprehend it, they shall find none other then God to protect them;The poore. peradventure they will feare his divine Majesty. Molest not them that pray unto God evening and morning, and that desire to see his face, thou shalt not be accomptable for their actions,See Gelaldin. neither shall they give accompt of what thou dost; if thou disturbest them, thou shalt be in the number of the unjust. We have proved men by one another; they have said among them with derision, behold those among us, to whom God hath given his graces: doth God not know them that acknowledge his benefits? Salute with affection true believers, when they come to visite thee? God loveth civility, clemency, and humanity, and will pardon him among  you, that shall offend him through ignorance that shall repent of his error, and doe good works, he is benigne and mercifull. Thus doe I recount the graces of God, and discover the way of sinners; Say unto them, I am forbidden to worship what you adore, lest I should goe astray from the right way. I have received from God a light, which yee have contemned; God is Judge of all things, judgeth with truth, and is most just in his Judgements. I cannot forthwith give you a sight of the torments of hell, neither of the chastisement of God, which you with so much instance require; this dependeth on his divine Majesty; had I this power, our difference would be soon at a period. God knoweth the unjust, in his power are the keys of the future, none knoweth but he; he knoweth whatsoever is in the earth, and the sea, the number of the leaves that fall from the trees, and of the atomes that are in the darknesse of the earth. There is nothing dry or greene in the earth, that is not written in the Book of Light. He it is that causeth you to die in the night, and knoweth the good and evill that you have committed by day; he shall cause you to rise againe at the day nominated; you all shall appeare before him, he shall give you knowledge of your sins, and shall chastise you after your demerits; he is alwayes victorious and omnipotent. He shall send to observe your actions; and when you shall arrive at the hour of death, he shall dispatch his messengers, who shall not faile to execute his commands; the people shall repaire to him, as to their Lord, he is extreamly exact to keep account. Say unto them, he shall deliver you from the darknesse of the sea, and of the earth; when you shall in secret, or publikely invoke him; if he deliver me, I will returne him thanks for his grace: Say unto them, God can deliver you from darkenesse, and all other afflictions; yet say you, he hath a companion associate with him: Say unto them, we can send punishments from above, and from below; he is able to disunite, and cause you to tast a thousand miseries, which you shall bring upon each other. Consider how I shew them the effects of my Omnipotency; they will peradventure comprehend my sayings: Those of  thy Nations have rejected them, notwithstanding they are most true: say unto them, I am not your Tutor; every thing hath its time, you shall hereafter understand the truth. Depart from them that speake of our Law with contempt, untill he speak otherwise; the devill would induce thee to forget my Commandements, and cause thee to sit down with the unjust: the true believers shall not regard their discourse, neither cease to ^dmonish them, peradventure they will be converted. Depart thou from such as sport and mock at their Religion, the wealth of this world rendreth them haughty; declare, they shall be severely punished; none is able to protect or hear them but God, no ransome is able to deliver them; they shall find the good and ^vill that they have committed, shall drink a liquor extreamly cold, and endure grievous torments, because of their impiety; say unto them, shall we worship instead of God, what can neither benefit nor hurt us? Shall we return on our steps to our sins, having been guided by his divine Majesty, like unto him whom the devill hath seduced? He left him dismaid, and astonished in the midst of his voyage, having forsaken his companions, that shewed him the right way. God guideth men to the way of Salvation I will wholly resigne my self to the pleasure of his divine Majesty: Make your prayers at the time appointed, and pay tithes, you all shall appear before God at the day of Judgement, to give account of your actions. He it is that created heaven and earth* Remember thou the day wherein he said, Be thou, and every thing was: he shall reign, and at that day command an Angell to sound the Trumpet, to call to universall Judgement, the living and the dead. He knoweth the future, present, and past; is most ^ise, and nothing is hidden from him: Remember thou that Abraham said to his father The Arabian^ say, Az^r (...) Abrahams ^urna ^e, and ^hat his fath^r was called Terec Azer. Azer, wherefore doe you worship Idols instead of God? I perceive your family to be in manifest error: God shewed to Abraham the Kingdome of heaven, and of earth, and he was in the number of the blessed. Abraham seeing by night a most cleare Star, asked in himselfe, if it were his God; no, replyed he to himself, my God doth not rise and set; seeing the Moone  to arise, he demanded if that were his God; no, said he to himself, certainly God will not guide me to be of them that are erronious: when he beheld the Sun rising, he likewise asked, if that were his God; and when he saw it set, he said to his people, I am innocent of the sin which you commit, in adoring many gods, I wholly commend my self to his Will, who created heaven and earth, and professe his Unity: His people would dispute against him; he said to them, will you dispute against me concerning the Unity of God, who hath instructed me in the right way? I feare not your Idols, my God doth what pleaseth him, and knoweth all things, will you not consider it? How shall I feare your Idols, since you are not afraid to affirme, that God hath companions equall to him, which you have no reason to adore? If you understand the truth, who is more true, you, or I? Such as believe in God, and shall not cover the truth with a lie, shall be delivered from the torments of hell, and conducted into the way of salvation. We instructed Abraham with reasons to dispute against his people; I give knowledge to whom I see go^d, and exalt whom I please. Thy Lord, O Abraham seeth and knoweth all things; we gave to Abraham, Isaac, and J^c^b his sons; we before instructed Noah and his lineage in the right way; we taught it David, Salomon, Job, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, Zachary, St. John, Jesus the Sonne of Ma^y, Eliah, Ismael, Joshua, Jonas, and Lot; we gratified them above the residue of the world; we elected their Fathers, Brothers, and Progenie, and guided them in the right way: Thus God guideth whom he seeth good: Men before adored Idols, and believed there were many gods, neverthelesse he blotted out their past errors, when they were converted. If they slander them that have knowledge of the Scriptures, and of Prophesies, will give power over their persons to men that shall mislead them with the Infidels: Those whom God guideth, believe in the Unity of his divine Majesty. Say unto them I require no reward for having preached to you the Alcoran, he teacheth to all the world the Commandements of God. The Jewes have not honoured him as was their duty,  they understood not his graces, when they said, he hath instructed the people in nothing that is profitable. Say unto them, who gave the Tables unto Moses? who instructed him in the Scripture, which they have written in Vellam, to guide and illuminate the people? They have published what pleaseth them, and have concealed much; they shall learn in the Alcoran what they know not, and what their fathers understood not: Say to them, God after that left them obstinate, and amazed in their errors. We have sent from heaven that Book full of blessedness, it confirmeth the Scriptures that were sent before it, to the end thou maist instruct the people of Mecca, them that inhabit about that City, and the rest of the world. Such as shall believe in the day of Judgement, believe in what is written in this Book, and shall pray to God to deliver them from the torments of hell: Who is more unjust then he that blasphemeth against God? that saith, God hath inspired into him what he uttereth, notwithstanding he hath received no inspiration from his Divine Majestie. Who more unjust, then he that saith, he will cause to discend from heaven, things like to those which God inspired into his Prophets? When thou shalt see the wicked at the point of death, and the Angels stretching forth their hands to take their souls: say unto them, This day the torments of hell shall be the punishment of the blasphemies that ye have vomited against God, and your disobedience to his Commandements. God shall say to them, you are come before us without riches, and children, naked as you were created, and have cast behind your backs the instructions which we gave you; I see not with you the Idols you adored; you are separated from each other, and have forsaken them, that you esteemed on earth, should have been your protectors; God separateth the good from the wicked, as the corn from the ear, and the stone from the Date: He causeth the living to spring from the dead, and the dead from the living: behold the works of God; why will you depart from his Law? He divideth the morning from darkness, hath established night for the repose of men, and the Sun and Moon to compute  ages, years, moneths, and seasons; such are the effects of Gods power, he is Omnipotent, and knoweth all things. He it is that created the Stars to give you light, and guide you in the obscurity of the earth and sea; he gratifieth with his grace, and such as learn his Commandements. He it is that created you of one sole person, that gave you the earth to inhabit, and preserveth you in the world, hee hath conferred his grace on such as have obeyed his Commandements, hath made raine to descend from heaven, and caused the earth to produce divers sorts of herbs, green things, and corn; he hath caused the Date to spring forth, and the Palme tree, with gardens enriched with Grapes, Olives, Pomgranets, and many fruits alike, and different. Consider how fruits encrease and multiply; this serveth for instruction of Gods Unity, to them that have his fear before their eyes: the Infidels have adored the devill, with God, who created them, and said, that God hath sons and daughters, such is their ignorance; praised be God, he created heaven and earth; how shall he have a son, who hath no wives? He created and knoweth all things, he is your God, and your Lord, there is none other God but he; worship him, he conserveth all things, he is seen of no man, and beholdeth all things, he is benigne, and nothing is concealed from him. O people, there is come to you a light from your Lord to conduct you, he that seeth clearly shall receive advantage; and he that shall be blinde, shall continue his miserie; I am your Tutor, neither observe I what you do; Thus do I declare the mysteries of my Law, the wicked shall in the end confesse that thou hast taught my Commandements to such as inclined to learn them. Act what thy Lord hath inspired into thee, there is no God but he; separate thy selfe from the societie of unbelievers; Had it pleased God, they had not disobeyed his Commandements, thou art not their Tutor, injure not them that worship Idols, they injure God through malice and ignoranc^ every man esteemeth what he hath done, and pleaseth himself in his opinion. Certainly they shall all be assembled at the day of Judgement, and be chastised after their demerits.  They have sworn by the name of God to fight for the faith, if some miracle appeare to instruct them; miracles proceed from God, they know not the time wherein he will make them to appeare; although they should see miracles, they will not be converted. I will overturne their hearts, blind their sight, and they shall never be converted, I will leave them in their errors, and disobedience, with contempt and confusion. If we should send to them Angels, should the dead come and speake to them, and should we bring about them all the witnesses of the world, they shall not believe, if it so please God, most of them are ignorant; we have allotted an enemy to each Prophet; as the Devill is an enemy to men, he tempteth them with the ornament of his discourses, to render them proud. If it had pleased thy Lord, they had wanted that power; depart thou from unbelievers, and their blasphemies, and incline not to their will; they shall find no advantage in their impiety. Do you desire another Judge then God, who hath sent to you the Book that distinguisheth good from evill; Such as know the Scripture are not ignorant that this Book was sent from God, and containeth the Truth; Be not thou in the number of them that doubt, the word of God exactly commeth to passe, no man can hinder its effects, God understandet^ and knoweth all things. If thou incline to the will of most men, they will seduce thee, they believe but their own opinions, and are lyars. Thy Lord knoweth them that erre, and such as follow the right way. Eat what shall be slain in pronouncing the name of God; they taught you what was forbidden, eat not, unlesse constrained through necessity: Many erre from the right way, and pursue their own appetites, and ignorance, God beholdeth them that offend him; flie publike and secret sinne, sinners shall be severely chastised; eat not of what is not let-bloud in pronouncing the name of God, lest you disobey his Commandements. The Devils will tempt them that serve them, they will perswade unbelievers to dispute against you, if you incline to them, you shall be Infidels as they are. I raised again many of them that were dead  through their sinnes, I converted them, and gave them a light to illuminate them, in the darknesse, wherein Infidels shall dwell for ever, because they delight in their disobedience: Thus will I place in every City, leaders, that shall seduce the wicked, and themselves, but shall not understand it: When they beheld any signe (of the truth of the Prophet) appeare; they said, they will not believe in him, unlesse he were accompanied with the vertues, and merits of other Prophets; God maketh choyce of them on whom he conferreth the grace of prophecie, he shall chastise such as discourse in that manner, with ignominie in this world, and they shall feel in the other great torments, by reason of their impietie. God rejoyceth the hearts of them that he inclineth to lead into the way of Salvation, and punisheth them that digresse from the right path; his wrath fell upon the Infidels so soon as he ascended into Heaven. The way thou followest is the right way; we have recompensed such as have understanding to profit, they shall be happy, God shall be their protector, because of their good works. Remember thou the day wherein we shall assemble the people, and when it shall be said to the Devils, Oh ye bands of Devils! wherefore are you risen against men? The chiefe of those men that shall have obeyed them, shall answer, Lord, suffer us to be revenged on each other, and let each command in his turn;See Gelaldin. Oh Lord, teach us the prefixed time that thou hast appointed to our miseries: The Angels shall answer, Hell shall be your habitation, you shall there remaine eternally, and so long as it shall please God: Your Lord is most wise, and omniscient; the wicked shall obey the wicked, because of their sinnes. Oh ye Bands of men and Devils! have you not seen my Prophets, and Apostles of your own Nation, who have given you to see Miracles? who have preached my Commandements, and the day of Judgement? They shall answer, they have seen the Prophets, and Apostles, but that the life of the world rendred them proud, and shall confesse themselves to have been wicked. God shall not destroy Mecca for the injustice therein committed, untill he hath sent an Apostle to  the Inhabitants, to teach them his Commandements; every one shall be punished according to his works, thy Lord knoweth whatsoever is done in the world. Hee hath no need of his people, he is altogether mercifull, he can destroy you if it please him, and establish in your place another people, as he hath established you in the place of your predecessors. If you be not converted, you shall not escape the torments of Hell; Say unto them, do as you understand him, I will comport my selfe, as I shall apprehend him; you shall in the end understand who shall have the good part in the other world. None shall give succour to Idolaters, they, they offer to their Idols of the fruits that God hath created, and say, (following their thoughts) behold our God! Such sacrifices ascend not to God, their Idolatrie hath induced many of them to sacrifice their own Children to their false Gods, they have destroyed them, and were ensnared in their Religion; which they had not done, had it so pleased God; Separate thy selfe from them and their blasphemies they have said, that the fruits of the earth, and the benefits of God were unclean, and would not eat of them. God giveth food but to those whom he is pleased to gratifie. They have prohibited to ride on some beasts that God gave them, and slew them for food, without pronouncing the name of his divine Majestie, which is a great sin, but they shall be punished according to their demerits, They have said it is lawfull for men to eat what is in the bellies of beasts, and that it is unlawfull for their wives, and when they had slain them, they did eat for company; but God shall chastise them for their discourse, he is most wise, and Omniscient. Such as slay their Children are wretched men, fooles and ignorant, they have forbidden to eat the good things that God hath given them, to blaspheme, and are gone astray from the right way. It is God who created the gardens full of fruits, and herbs of divers colours, with Olives, Pomegranets, and other fruits alike, and different: Eat of the fruits of the Earth: Pay the due, appointed when you reap, and dispense not your substance lightly; God abhorreth prodigals: Of clean beasts, some there be that  have borne the burden, and others that are young, and have not borne it; Eat what God hath given you, and follow not the foot-steps of the Devill, he is your open enemie. Say unto them, behold eight paire of beasts, viz. two paire of Weathers,See Kitab el tenoir. two of Ewes, two of Camels, and two paire of Cowes, of which is it permitted, or forbidden you to eat? Is it lawfull for you to eat the males, or females? Which are those that God hath forbidden you? Who is more wicked then he that blasphemeth, to seduce from the right way the people that are ignorant? God guideth not the unjust; Say unto them, In all that God hath inspired into me, I finde not that it is prohibited to eat of those beasts, except they die of some disease, and if they be slain without pronouncing the name of God. The flesh of Swine is forbidden you; if you eat of it, you incurre the wrath of God; If any one be in necessity, and eateth without designe to provoke God, he shall find God gracious and mercifull. We forbad the Jews to eat of beasts whose feet were cloven, and of the fat of Beasts, except of such as is interlarded in the flesh, the entrails and the bones. We enjoyned this prohibition by reason of their sinne, and we are veritable in our words, and exact in our promises: If they slander thee, Say unto them, the mercy of God is great, and the wicked shall not avoid the punishment of their crimes. The Infidels have said, had it pleased God, we had not been unbelievers, neither our fathers also, and nothing had been prohibited. Their predecessors spake as they, untill they felt the punishment of their sins. Say unto them, Are you assured that God is content with your proceeding? Tell us, whence ariseth this assurance? You, in this, follow but your opinion, you are but lyers, Gods providence is great; he had guided all of you in the right way, had it so pleased him. Cause them come before us, who said, It is unlawfull to eat of clean Beasts; were they present when God made the Prohibition? If they say they were present, say not as they, Neither follow the appetites of blasphemous Infidels, who believe not in the end of the word, and worship many Gods. Say unto them, Come, I will instruct you what is  by God forbidden to be eaten; there is but one sole God, say not, he hath companions equal to him; do good to your Father and Mother, and slay not your children, in fear of dying with famine, God shall bestow on you and them also, what shall be necessary; commit not whoredome, either privately or publikely; kill no man, if justice do not command it: God requireth you to observe what is above (ordained) perhaps you will consider it. Take not the goods of Orphans, but to succour them, untill they be of age, of discretion, measure, and weight, with good weight, and just measure. I enjoyn no man any thing, but what is in his power to performe. Judge with equity, although it be against your parents and allies; satisfie what is above (ordained) God commandeth it, peradventure you will consider it; it is the right way, which you ought to pursue: go not aside, God commandeth it, perhaps you will fear his divine Majestie. We taught Moses our Commandements; it is a peculiar grace to instruct the righteous, and guide the people in the right way; it may be you will believe in the Resurrection. O ye Inhabitants of Mecca! We have sent to you the Alcoran, full of benediction, perform what is ordained, the impiety, your sins shall be forgiven you; say not, That God hath sent his Law to the two Nations that preceded you; and that it is hid from you. Will you say,The Jews and Christians. That had God taught you the Scripture, you had been more obedient then they? Certainly he hath taught you his Commandements, it is a speciall grace to guide you into the right way: Who is more unjust, then he that blasphemeth against his divine Majesty, and departeth from his Commandements? Such men shall be rigorously chastised in the fire of Hell. Will they expect that the Angels came to visit them? That God should punish, and declare to them his miracles? Will they look for the day of Judgement, wherein repentance and conversion shall be unprofitable? Such as believe in one part of the Law, and reject the other, have no foundation in their belief. God shall make them to know their errors, and shall punish them after the enormity of their crimes: He that shall do a good work, shall  have a reward tenfold. Whosoever acteth any wickedness, shall be punished in like manner; neither shall he receive injustice. Say unto them, God hath gvided me in the way of his Law; such as professe the Law of Abraham, profess the unity of God; Abraham was not in the number of unbelievers; my prayers, my vows, my life, my death shall be consecrated to God; he hath no companion, I wholly commend my selfe to his divine pleasure. Say unto them, Do I desire to worship other God, then the Lord of the Universe? The good that a man doth, is for himselfe, and the evill that he committeth is against him; you all shall one day appear in the presence of God, he shal resolve your disputes. He it is that prolongeth your posterity, and exalteth some above others, to prove you; your Lord is exact to chactise the wicked, and gracious and mercifull to the righteous.   CHAP. VII. The Chapter of Prisons, containing an hundred and six Verses, written at Mecca.  Reader, Mahomet entituled this Chapter, the Chapter of Aaraf, which is a place between Paradise and Hell, where men suffer no punishment. See Mokari, Bedaoi, and Kitab el tenoir.  IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull: I am God, the most wise, the most true. This Book was sent to thee, to preach to the True-beleevers; doubt not the Contents of it. Say unto them, Believe in what was sent to you from your Lord, and worship none other God but him; few there be among you that consider it. How many Cities have we destroyed? How often have we inflicted our punishment on their Inhabitants by day, and by night, when they reposed? Neverthelesse, they said nothing, but that they were greatly afflicted. We will examine the people to whom we have sent our Prophets, and  require account of what they have learned, and of what they have done. We will examine our Prophets, and demand an account of such as have followed, and obeyed them. I will cause them to remember what they have done worthy of reward. We forsook not our Prophets when they preached to them the Truth; their actions shall be weighed in the ballance of equity; the ballance of the blessed shall be ponderous with good works; and they whose ballance shall be light of good works, shall be damned, for having contemned our Commandements. We gave you your habitation on the Earth, and there bestowed on you what was necessary for your nourishment; but few of you are gratefull to me. We created and formed you, and commanded the Angels to worship Adam, which they performed, except the devill, to whom we said, what hindred thee to worship Adam, when we comanded thee? He answered, I am better then he, thou hast created me of fire, and hast created man of the mire of the earth; then said we to him, depart out of Paradise, it is not the habitation of the proud, thou shalt be in the number of them that shall be laden with ignominy; the Devill answered, Let me alone untill the day of the Resurrection of the dead; wherefore hast thou tempted me? I will seduce men from the right way, I will hinder them on the right hand, and on the left, and on all sides, to believe in thy Law, and the greatest part of them shall be ungratefull: we said to him, be gone out of Paradise, thou shalt be abhorred of all the world, and deprived of my mercy; I will fill hell with such as shall follow thee. O Adam! dwell with thy wife in Paradise, and there eat of whatsoever shall please thee, but approach not that Tree, lest thou with thy wife be in the number of the unjust. The devill tempted them* and dispoyled their bodies of their vestments of grace; he said to them, God hath forbidden you to eat of the fruit of that Tree, that you may not be Angels, or eternall; he swore that he spake the truth, and filled them with ignominy, because of their pride. They knew their nakednesse, having eaten of that fruit, and to cover themselves, took leaves of Paradise; their Lord called them, and said,  Did I not forbid you to approach that Tree? I told both of you, that the devill was your open enemy; they said, Lord, we have offended thee, and injured our souls, if thou dost not compassionate us, we shall be in the number of the damned: he said, Depart out of Paradise, ye enemies of each other, you shall inhabit the earth, untill the time appointed; you shall there live and die, and go from the earth to the day of Judgement. O ye children of Adam! we bestowed on you vestment of graces, signes of our Omnipotency, peradventure you wil bear it in minde. O ye children of Adam! beware lest the devill seduce you, as he did your Father and Mother, when he caused their departure out of Paradise; he dispoyled them of their garments, and made them know their deformity; he shall appear to you, with such as follow them, and you shall see him, when you least think thereon; he protecteth the Infidels: when they commit any fault, they say, we follow the Law of our Fathers, God hath so commanded us. Say unto them, Doth God command you to offend him? Will you speak of God what you know not? he hath appointed you to doe Justice, to worship him, and embrace his Law. Many shall rise again, as you have seen them; some shall be in the right way, others shall be damned, because they have obeyed the devill, and believed they were in the right way. O children of Adam, cloath your selves decently, when you shall repaire to the Temples; eat and drink what pleaseth you; be not prodigall, God abhorreth them that spend their wealth unprofitably: Say unto them, who made the prohibition of decent cloathing, when men go to the Temple to worship God? Who hath forbidden to eat of the goods that God hath given you? This is lawfull for true believers. God shall so expound his Commandements at the day of Judgement. Say unto them, God hath forbidden you whoredome, private and publike, disobedience, injustice, desire to adore any other god but him, and to speake of his divine Majesty what you know not: every one hath his predestination, and none can advance or retard it. O ye children of Adam, did not the Prophets teach you my Commandements?  Such as shall fear me, and do good works, shall be delivered from affliction ^t the day of Judgement; and they that disobey my Commandements, that arise against the Faith, shall dwell eternally in hell fire. Who is more unjust, then he that blasphemeth against God and his Commandements? Such shall be punished conformably to the Scripture. When the Angels of death shall cause them to die, they shall say, Where be the Idols that you adored instead of God? they shall answer, that those false gods have forsaken them, and shall acknowledge their Idolatry; but God shall say to them, enter into hell with the men and devils that are condemned; they shall execrate the Sec^s that preceded them; and being assembled, they shall say, Lord, judge them, they seduced us, augment their miseries in hell. God shall say, We will adde to their, and your pains, but you understand it not. They shall say among themselves, we are not the cause that you were unbelievers, you were not such to please us, suffer with us the torments that you have merited. I will not open the gate of heaven to such as disobey my Commandements, untill a Camell pass through the eye of a needle, so will I chastise sinners, hell shall be their bed, fire shall be their covering; and such as shall have done good works; according to their power, shall dwell eternally in Paradise. I will remove deceit far from their heart, rivers shall flow in their fields with delights; and they shall say, praysed be God, who hath brought us hither, otherwise we had bin in the number of the erronious: Certainly the Prophets, Gods Messengers, taught us the truth, in saying, the observance of the Commandements of his divine Majesty should render us heirs of Paradise. Such as shall be saved, shall tell the damned, that they have found the grace foretold them of God, and we will demand of them, if they have not met with the punishment that his divine Majesty did denounce against them; they shall say aloud, Yes, and that the curse of God is upon the unjust, that misled men from his Law, and they shall be eternally in the number of the miserable. The Mahometan Doctors believe, that such as shall have do^e as much good as evil, and whose ballance shall not decline, neither on the scale of good works or of bad, shall dwell in the place called Aaraf, with them that have done neither good nor evill; and this place is between Hell and Paradise. Between the blessed and the damned, there is a separation, and a place called Aaraf, or prisons, wherin are  many persons, who know the blessed and the damned by their countenances, they call to the blessed and salute them, yet they go not into Paradise, notwithstanding their great desire to enter. When they turn their eyes towards the damned; Lord, (say they) involve us not in the number of the unjust. Such as are in that place, call to the damned, they know them by their visages, and say, to what served your riches? and that ye arose against the Faith, and Commandements of God? Behold the faithfull (whom ye contemned) you swore they should be deprived of mercy; God hath spoken to them, and hath said, enter into Paradise, and fear not, you shall for ever be exempt from affliction; the damned shall cry unto the blessed, Give us of the water which you drink, and the meats that you eat; they shall answer, The drink and bread of Paradise is prohibited to Infidels, who sported with their faith, that were proud of the wealth of the earth, and that scoffed at the Commandements of God; he hath forgotten them, because they forgot the comming of the day of Judgement, and blasphemed against his precepts. We are come to the Inhabitants of Mecca to instruct them in the Alcoran; we teach it unto men, to give them knowledge of the right way, and to acquire the mercy of God, if they believe in that Book: Shall they expect to believe untill they know its explication? Its explication shall appear at the day of Judgement; that day, such as shall have lived without faith, shall say, Certainly the Prophets delivered the Truth; shall we partake of their prayers, will they intercede for us, untill we return to the world to do better then we have done, and to obey Gods Commandements? But they shall be damned, because of their blasphemies. God is your Lord, he created the heaven; and the earth in six dayes, and sitteth on his Throne; he causeth the night incontinently to succeed the day; the Sun, the Moone, and the Stars, move at his command, and all the world obeyeth him; praised be God, Lord of the Universe: pray to God privately and publikely, he abhorreth the unjust; pollute not the earth, after the ordure is removed; pray to God to avoid his chastisements, and obtain his mercy, which is  for the righteous. It is God that sendeth the windes to dissipate the rain, when they carry the clouds; we drive them charged with water, into places drie, dead, and ruined, and cause the rain to fall there, that they may produce herbs and fruits; so will we cause the dead to arise again; perhaps men will remember the good land bringeth forth good fruits, through the permission of its Lord, and the bad land produceth only darneill. I teach my Commandements to such as are not ingratefull: Certainly we sent Noah to instruct men; he said, O ye people, worship one God alone; if you adore other then him, you shall be punished at the day of Judgement; their Rulers answered, O Noah! thou art in a great error; He replyed, I erre not, I am a messenger sent from God to preach his Will; I give you most wholsome advise, God hath taught me what you know not. Is it strange to you, that he hath sent you his Commandement by the tongue of a man like your selves, to declare to you the torments of Hell? Fear God, he will pardon your sinnes; But they belyed Noah, we saved him in the Arke, with his retinue, and drowned those that contemned our Law, they were altogether blinde. We sent Hod to his brother Aad, and to his retinue, he said, Oh ye people? worship one God alone, whom will ye adore, or whom feare, but God? The Teachers answered, thou art in an extream ignorance; we believe thee to b^ in the number of lyars; he replyed, I am not a lyar, I am a messenger sent from God, to preach his Commandements, I give good and salutary advice, wonder not that God teacheth you his precepts by the tongue of a man, like you, who declareth to you his pleasure. Remember that he left you on Earth after Noah, that he encreased you in number, force, and power; Call to minde his grace, you shall be happy. They answered, are we come to this, to worship one God alone, and to relinquish what our fathers adored? Shew us the truth, whereof thou dost preach, if thou art true; he said, the wrath and indignation of God shall fall upon you; will you dispute with us of the names, that you and your fathers imposed on your Idols?  God did not enjoyne to worship them, neither have you reason to doe it; expect your punishment, I will expect it with perseverance. Then did we deliver him from their malice, and all the true believers that were with him, and destroyed those Infidels, by reason of their impiety. Wee sent Salhe to Temod, and his people; he said to them, Oh ye people! worship but one God, he shall shew you a miracle in this The Turks believe that Salhe, through Gods permission metamorphosed a rock into a Camel. Camel, suffer it to feed on the Earth, and do to it no harm, left you be chastised: Remember, how God left you on the Earth after Aad, he gave you to dwell in the vallies, in the plaines, and mountaines; Remember God, and pollute not the Earth any more. Their Captains who were proud, demanded of the poore, if they believed that Salhe was indeed the Messenger of God? they answered, We believe in his words, and in his doctrine; Then said those proud men, We abjure what ye believe, we condemne him, and they slew the Camel of Salhe in derision, disobeyed the Commandements of God, and said, Oh Salhe! Let us now see the punishment that thou didst preach, if thou art of the Prophets; at the same time, an Earthquake, with thunder surprized them, and they remained dead as carkasses in their houses. Salhe forsook them, and said, Oh ye people! I declared to you the will of God with fidelity, but ye detest them that affect you, and give you good counsels. Remember thou how Lot spake to the people, saying, Will you daily defile your selves with whoredome? and with a filthinesse that was never yet seen in the world by any your Predecessours? Will you love men better then women? will you love sin rather then piety? They said, Let us expell Lot and his family from our Citie, for that they will not contaminate themselves with us, but God delivered him out of their hands, and those of his house* except his wife, who continued with them that were punished: We caused a raine to fall upon them, that destroyed all of them. Consider the end of the wicked: We sent Chaib to the Country of Madian, hee said, Oh ye people, worship one God alone, weigh with good weights, measure with good measure, and retaine nothing from your Neighbour:  Possesse not the high wayes, to give terrour to the people, Neither divert True-believers from the Law of God: Remember, that you were but a small handfull of men, and he caused you to multiply; consider the end of the wicked; If any among you embrace the faith, and others contemne it, have patience, untill God judge your differences, there is no better judge then he; Their Teachers said; Oh Chaib, wee will banish thee from Madian, thee and those that are of thy faith, if thou art of our Religion; he answered, should I not abhorre your Religion, I should blaspheme against God, who hath delivered me, I will follow it, if it please God, hee knoweth all things, I recommend my selfe wholly to the will of his divine Majesty; Lord judge our controversie, thou art the best Judge of the world. Then said their Teachers to the people, if you follow Chaib, you are damned; not long after an Earth-quake, and Thunder surprized them, and in the morning they were found dead in their houses; such as belyed Chaib, found no safety in their habitations, they were wretched, hee abandoned them, and said, Oh ye people! I have preached to you the will of God with fidelity; I will no longer afflict my selfe with the malice of the wicked. Wee infflicted sicknesse and poverty on them that disobeyed the Prophets, whom we sent to the Inhabitants of Madian; peradventure they will be converted. Wee proved them through diseases and health, and gratified them in many occurrences, yet they said, our fathers were afflicted with sicknesse and povertie, we shall be as they, but we chastised them for their sinne, when they least considered it. Had the Inhabitants of Mecca had our feare before their eyes, and obeyed our Commandements, we had opened to them the blessing of Heaven and Earth; wee will punish them, because they are impious: Some there be, that shall be afflicted in the night, when they sleep; and others that shall be tormented by day, when they sport, and recreate themselves; they believed God to be a deceiver, and are damned. God guideth into the right way True-believers, and makes  them Heire of the Earth, after their parents; had he so pleased, he might have destroyed all the world, he might have hardened the hearts of the people, and no man had harkned to his word. I recount what things befell that To Mecca. City, many Prophets have been sent to its Inhabitants, and wrought many miracles, yet would they not relinqui^h their former impietie; thus have we hardned the hearts of Infidels; they violated their promises, and wee found most of them to be wicked and disobedient. We sent Moses to Pharaoh, and his people, he to them shewed miracles, which through their malice they contemned, but consider the end of those wicked men; Moses said unto Pharaoh, I am a messenger sent from God, the God of the Universe; when I speak of God, I deliver the Truth; I am come, through his command, to tell thee, thou must dismisse with me the Children of Israel, and no longer detaine them in thy dominions. Pharaoh said, if thou commest from God, and art true in thy sayings, let us see some miracles; then he cast upon the ground his staffe, which was changed into a Serpent, shewed his hand, that appeared exceeding white to the eyes of the Spectators. The Doctors of Pharaoh said, this man is a Magician, he would have us to abandon our Country, what is your opinion? detain him prisoner, and his brother, and send into your Cities, to assemble Magicians. The Magicians of Pharaoh appearing before him, they said,Gelaldin saith Moses his hand was ^owne. what shall be our reward, if we shall be victorious? He replyed to them, you shall be well rewarded, and shall be of them that approach my person. They said, oh Moses! wilt thou first cast down thy staffe on the ground, or shall we ours? Moses bad them cast down theirs, which they did, enchanting the eyes of the spectators, and terrifying them with an extraordinary enchantment; God inspired Moses to cast down his Rod, which devoured the staves of the other, and the Truth appeared above falshood, and above the vanity of their actions; they were vanquished, to their confusion, forsook their magick, and prostrating themselves on the earth, uttered these words; We believe in the Lord of the Universe, the Lord of Moses,  and of Aaron; Pharaoh said to them, Ye believe in the God of Moses without my permission; this is a deceit, invented by you, to drive the people out of my Dominions; but you shall soon know the punishment that I will lay upon you, I will cut off your feete and hands, and command you to be crucified. They answered, We recommend our selves wholly to the will of God, whatsoever is thy revenge on us, thou shalt not hinder us to believe in the miracles that wee see, neither to obey the Commandements of his divine Majesty; Lord give us patience, and to dye in the number of True-believers. Then said Pharaoh's Doctors, dismisse Moses, and his people, that they may goe whither they see good, to pollute the Earth, that they may leave thee in quiet with thy Gods; He said, I will cause their Childeren to be slain, their wives to be abused, and I will inflict upon them a thousand torments. Moses said to his people; Implore succors of God with patience, and prayers, the whole Earth is Gods, he giveth it to inherit, to whom he seeth good: the other world is for the righteous. They said, Oh Moses! We, before, thy coming, desired the death of our enemies; he replyed, God will not destroy your enemies, to leave you alone upon the Earth, he shall behold your actions. We afflicted Pharaoh and his Subjects with famine, perhaps unbelievers will consider it. When any happinesse befell them, they said, they well deserved it, and when they fell into misery, they affirmed Moses and his people to be the cause of it; It is God that punished them, but of this most of them were ignorant. They said unto Moses, cease to shew us thy miracles to inchant us, we will not obey thee: We sent upon them a Deluge, Grasse-hoppers, Lice, Frogs, and Bloud, one after another; neverthelesse they were proud, and in the number of the wicked. When our wrath fell upon them, they said, oh Moses! call upon thy Lord, that hee give us what to thee he promised, remove his displeasure from us, we will believe thee, and will dismisse with thee, the Children of Israel: When we delivered them from affliction, they sharpened their  tongues, murmured, and violated their promises; we avenged our selves upon them, and drowned them in the Sea, for that they contemned our miracles, and we gave the West and East to the Children of Israel, who were humble before us; we gave them our blessing, our word was accomplished upon them, because of their perseverance, and we destroyed the Armies of Pharoah. The Children of Israel having past the Sea, met with men that adored Idols, and said, oh Moses! make unto us Gods, like to the Gods of this people; he answered, ye are ignorant; these men are wretched, what they doe is but ignorance and vanity; shall I desire that you worship other Gods, then God that preferred you to all the world? We have delivered you from Pharoah's people, who caused you to endure great torments, they murther'd your children, abused your wives, and you suffered heavy afflictions for the punishment of your sins. We detained Moses on the Mountaine thirty nights, and ten other nights, which is in all forty nights; when he went up, he said to his brother Aaron, be thou my Lieutenant, command this people in mine absence, and follow not the path of the wicked. When Moses at the time appointed arrived at the top of the Mountaine, and that his Lord spake to him, he said, Lord permit me to see thee, he said, thou shalt not see me; behold this Mountaine, if it continue firme in this place, thou shalt be able to see me; when the Lord appeared upon the Mountaine with his light, it was reduced to ashes, and Moses amazed, fell on the ground, as dead. When he rose againe, he said blessed be the name of God, I desire to obey him, and believe that no man living is able to behold him. He said to Moses, I have chosen and preferred thee to all the world, I have made thee a Prophet, thou hast talked with me, receive the grace which I have bestowed on thee, and be not ingratefull. We gave to him the Tables, whereon was written what was necessary for the salvation of men, and we said to him, receive with affection, what I give thee, and command thy people to observe the contents of those Tables. I will precipitate into Hell such as transgresse my Commandements;  I will deprive the proud of my graces, they will not believe in my Law, although they see all the miracles in the world; if they see the right way, they will not follow it; they see the way of error, and pursue it; because they have abjured my Commandements, and rejected my grace, the good works of them that disobey me, and that believe not in the Resurrection, are unprofitable, they shall be chastised after their demerits. The people of Moses, after his departure, adored the Calfe, a bellowing God, saw they not, that it spake not to them? neither could conduct them into the right way? Neverthelesse they adored it, for which they were greatly too blame. When this Calfe fell to the ground, and they found their errour, they said, if God have not pity on us, we shall be miserable. When Moses returned, he said to them, whom did ye obey after my departure? You were too hasty to worship that Idol; he in displeasure cast against the ground the Tables that God had given him, took his brother by the head, and dragging him to him, said Son of my mother, how hast thou governed this people? I wanted power, replyed he, and could not divert them from their evill; It wanted little but they had slain me, do me no harme; rejoyce not my enemies with my misery, and account me not with those that adored Idols: Moses said, Lord pardon me, and my brother, give us thy mercy; thou art the mercifull of the mercifull. The wrath of God, and the infamy of the world shall fall upon them that worshiped the Calf, and blasphemed against God; he will be pitifull to such as shall repent, and believe in his divine Majesty. The displeasure of Moses being allayed, he againe tooke the Tables, whereon was written the way of salvation, for such as have the feare of their Lord before their eyes; he caused to be separated from his people, at a time appointed, threescore and ten persons, who were surprized with an earth-quake, and with thunder; and said, Lord, thou couldst have destroyed them, before they adored the Calf; wilt thou destroy us all, because of the sin of the ignorant that are amongst us? Thou hast desired to prove this people; thou guidest, and causest to  erre whom thou pleasest; thou art our Protector, pardon our sins; for thou art altogether mercifull; give us thy grace in this world, and guide us to the day of Judgement, neer to thy divine Majestie: He said, I will punish as I see good, my mercy embraceth the whole world; it is for such as have my feare before their eyes, that pay Tithes, obey my Commandements, follow the right way, believe in the Prophet, This is Mahomet. who can neither write nor read, and what is written in the Old Testament, and the Gospell;See Kitab el tenoir. he shall command them things honest; he shall prohibit things uncivill; he shall teach them what meats are clean, and forbid them to eat what is unclean; he shall deliver them from Ceremonies, weighty and trublesome, and from the chains that strictly bind them: Such as shall believe in him, that shall honour him, that shall defend him from his enemies, and follow the light that we shall send him, shall be happy. Say unto the people, I am indeed a messenger sent from God, to whom appertaineth the kingdome of the Heavens,The Turks believe that Mahomet could neither write nor read. and of Earth; there is but one God alone, he giveth life and death, as seemeth good to him. Believe in God, and in his Prophet, who can neither read nor write. Such as shall believe in God, in his Word, and follow the Prophet, shall not erre; they shall follow a very good way. There are some of the children of Israel that knew the truth, and judge with equity. We divided them into twelve Tribes, when Moses required drink for his people, we inspired him to strike the rock with his rod, whence flowed twelve fountains, and every one knew the place where he should drink; we covered them with the shaddow of clouds; we caused Manna and Quailes to descend upon them, and commanded them to eat of the good things which we gave them. They did not hurt us (when they murmured) but afflicted themselves.This is the holy land. It was said to them, Dwell in this City, and eat therein what shall please you; enter at the gate with adoration,See Gelaldin. and beg pardon of your sinnes. I will pardon you, and will augment the graces of the righteous; nevertheless the wicked that were among them, altered the words that were spoken to them, and perverted  them; and we sent upon them our indignation from Heaven, because of their impiety. Ask of them concerning a village that was upon the shore of the Sea, whose inhabitants observed not the Sabbath, and fished on the day of rest; they saw in that day, Serpents appear upon the water, and other dayes they saw none. Thus are tryed them, because of their disobedience: A party of them said, Fish not, O people, it is lost labor; God shall destroy and chastise them with grievous torments, then their Doctors said, They shall implore pardon of the Lord, perhaps they will fear to offend him another time. When they rejected what we taught them; we saved such among them as abstain from evil-doing, and grievously afflicted the wicked, because of their disobedience; when they gloried in their sin, we said to them, Be ye contemned, and abhorred, as Apes; thy Lord shall send to them at the day of Judgement, persons to torment them; he is exact in punishing the wicked, and mercifull to the righteous. We sent upon them good and evill, to prove them, peradventure they will be converted. Their posterity left a progeny, heirs of their doctrine; nevertheless, they returned to their sins, and say, the Lord shall pardon them; they beg pardon of him; and return daily to their sin:See Gelaldin. Shall not account be required from them, of what is ordained in the Scripture? To wit, not to speak of God, but with truth: They have read the Truth, but have not comprehended it. Paradise is onely for the righteous; I will not deprive them of recompense, who make their prayers at the time appointed, and observe what is contained in the Scriptures. Remember thou, how we raised a mountain over them, to shelter them, and how they believed it would fall upon their heads; wee said to them, Learne with affection what we teach you, and remember; perhaps you will feare disobedience. Thy Lord caused to come out of Adams reins, all his posteritie; and asked them, saying, Am not I your Lord? they answered, yes, thou art our Lord, we know it well: They cannot therefore say at the day of Judgement, That they knew not his unitie; they shall say for excuse, Our fathers adored  many gods before us, we are their posterity; wilt thou destroy us, because of their iniquity? Thus doe I discover my mysteries to men; it may be they will be converted. Relate to them the history of him that saw our miracles; he was dispoiled of his understanding, the Devill followed it, and he was in the number of the wretched. Had we so pleased, we had exalted him through the knowledge of our wonders, among the Doctors; but he crouched to the ground, and followed his owne appetite, like to a chafed dog; if thou chase him with choller, he putteth forth his tongue; if thou leave him at rest, he will still put forth his tongue, like to the Infidels, that contemn our instructions; if thou recount to them our miracles, or do not recount, perhaps they will be converted, perhaps they will not be converted, and shall be like such as have abjured our Commandements, and injured their own souls. He whom God guideth, is well guided; and he whom God mis-leadeth, is in the number of the miserable. We have created Hell to punish* Devils and men; they have hearts, and comprehend no^ the truth; they have eyes, and see it not; ears have they, and heare it not; they are like to beasts, and worse then beasts; they are altogether ignorant. The most beautifull names of the world appertaine to God: Beseech him by the beauty of his name, and depart from them that depart from the truth, through the names that they impose on their Idols; they shall be chastised after their demerits. Some there be that follow the truth, and judge with equity, I will by degrees punish them that shall reject our Commandements, when they shall think thereon. I will defer their punishment some time, because my wrath is violent: Remember they not, that they said, Mahomet is possest of the Devill? On the contrary, he declareth the joyes of Paradise, and preacheth the torments of Hell. Consider they not the Kingdome of Heaven and of Earth, which God hath created of nothing? The fear of death shall arrive before they have acknowledged their sins; in what will they believe, if they have not faith in the Alcoran? He whom God shall mis-lead, shall find none to  guide him; he shall leave Infidels confounded in their disobedience. They shall enquire of thee concerning the hour and day of Judgement. Say unto them, No man knoweth it but God; but the greatest part of the world believe it not. I have not power to do either good or evill of my self, if God do not permit it; If I knew the future, I should provide wealth to preserve me from poverty: I am sent only to declare the joyes of Paradise, and preach the torments of Hell to them that believe in God; he it is that created you of one sole person, and created his spouse of his rib, to dwell with her: When she doubted of being with child, she ceased not to travell as she was wont; but when her conception rendred her heavy, they both besought God, their Lord, and said, Lord give an happy progeny, to the end we may be in the number of them that return thee thanks for thy favours. When God gave them a son, a r^ghteous man, they associated him in what he had given them; and all of them exalted the glory of his divine Majesty, above the Idols of the Infidels, that adored things which could create nothing, that are things created, and can do neither good nor harme. If you call Idolaters to th^ right way, they will not follow you; if ye invoke Idols, misery shall be upon you; will you be mute, to professe the unity of God? will you worship the Creatures, instead of the Creators Go, adore your Idols, and may they heare your prayers, if you believe them to be Gods: Have they feet to walk, hands to touch, eys to see, and eares to heare? Say unto them, if ye invoke your Idols, and conspire against me, you shall find none to protect you, God is my protector, he hath caused the Alcoran to descend from Heaven, he is the defendor of the righteous, what ye adore, can neither benefit nor hurt you; If thou invokest Idols, they shall not heare thee, they shall look upon thee, and shall not see thee; do what is lawfull to be done, command things honest, and depart from the ignorant; if the Devill would seduce thee, trust in God, he heareth and knoweth all things; such as fear him remember his mercies and chastisements when they are tempted of the Devil.  Although Infidels know the Truth, the Devill ceaseth not to continue them in their sin, they alwayes follow their impiety; If thou goest to them to instruct them, they say, thou singest an old song, say unto them, I doe what my Lord inspired into me, what I teach you, is the light of faith, the right way, and the grace of God for them that believe in his divine Majesty; for such as heare the Alcoran, and study it, perhaps God will give you his mercy. Remember thou ^od in thy soul, worship in publique and private, pray unto him evening, and morning, and be not in the number of the ignorant. The Angels that are near to thy Lord, neglect not to worship him, they prayse and adore him with humility.   CHAP. VIII. The Chapter of the spoile, containing seventy and five verses, written at Medina. Mahomets men differed concerning division of the spoyle, which they took at the battell of Beder; Mahomet divided it among them.IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. They will demand of thee, to whom appertaineth the spoyle? Say unto them, the spoyle appertaineth to God, and his Prophet; Feare God, live with mutuall amity, and obey his divine Majesty, and his Prophet, if you believe in his Law; Such as feare when they heare mention of God, who augment their faith, when they have heard relation of his miracles, who trust in him, who persevere in their prayers, and dispend in pious works some part of their wealth, believe in the unity of his divine Majesty; they have the degree of their habitation in Paradise, shall receive from their Lord pardon of their sinnes, and exceeding great treasure. When thy Lord caused thee to goe out of thine house to goe against the Infidels, a party of the true believers had a great aversion to fighting,See Gelaldin. they disputed with thee the necessity of Combats, having seen and known that their enemies led them to a certain death; Call to mind, that God promised you, that a party of the Army of the Enemies should obey you. Desire you  other thing then the glory and honour of victory? God confirmeth the Truth by his words, and destroyeth the wicked, he ratifieth the Truth, and destroyeth falshood, although it be contrary to the will of the impious. Remember, that your Lord heard you, when you of him implored succors, and that he assisted you with a thousand of his Angels sent from Heaven; God sent you this aide, only to let you know his grace, and to confirme your hearts; victory proceedeth from God, he is omnipotent, and most prudent: Remember that God covered you with a secure sleep, and caused water to descend from Heaven, to wash, purifie, and deliver you from the malice of the Devill. Plant in your heart generosity, and patience, and goe on with assurance. God hath said to his Angels, I will be with you, confirme the steps of the True-believers; I will cast feare into the heart of the wicked, strike them on the head, smite them on the fingers, and feet, because they have contradicted my will, and that of the Prophet. God severely chastiseth such as disobey his Commandements, and oppose the will of his Prophet; the unbelievers have heretofore tasted of his punishments in this world, and shall in the end feele the paines of the fire of Hell. Oh yee who believe in God! turne not the back to the wicked, as vanquished, when they approach to fight you, he that shall turne the back, shall returne in the wrath of God, and be throwne headlong into the fire of Hell. You slew not the Infidels at the fight of Beder, God himselfe slew them.See Gelaldin. Ob Mahomet. Thou didst not cast stones against them, God did cast them to advantage the True-believers; he understandeth whatsoever they say, and knoweth all their actions: certainly, he will augment the affliction of the wicked. When ye required victory, it was given you; if you relinquish your impiety, you shall doe well; if you retutne to fight against the Prophet, know, that he will protect him against you; your men of War shall advantage you in nothing, notwithstanding they be numerous; for that God is with the True-believers. O ye that believe, obey God and his Prophet, depart not from him, since ye have heard the Commandements  of his divine Majesty, be not as those that say, We have heard, and were deaf and dumb. The ignominy and misery that God layeth ^n beasts, is to be deaf and dumb, and to want the use of reason: Had God seen any good inclination in the Infidels, he had not left them in their de^f^nesse; but although they had heard clearly, they should have alwayes departed from his Law, and have been obstinate. O ye that believe in God! obey God and the Prophet, demand life eternall in your prayers, and know that God will separate the Gall fr^m the Liver; he will separate the Infidell from the True-believer, and you all shall appeare before him, to be ^^compensed and chastised ^or your works; feare the punishment that shall be inflicted, especially on the seditious, and ingratefull, God is ^evere in his chastisements; Remember that in the territory of Mecca ye were but ^n handfull of weak men, and with feare of being taken, and destroyed by the unbelievers; God saved, protected, and enriched you with all manner of good things, peradventure ye will give him thanks. Oh ye that believe! betray not God, no^ the Prophet, neither such as confide in you, and have entrusted their wealth in your hands, otherwise your riches, and children shall torment you in the other world. There is with God great reward for the righteous. O ye that believe! if ye feare God, he shall remove your enemies farre from you, and pardon your sinnes, his goodnesse is infinite. The wicked have conspired against thee, to punish and stay thee, or drive thee from M^cca; but God hath rendred their conspiracy ineffectuall, he knoweth all the designs of conspirators. When his miracles were related to them, and his Commandements taught them, they said, we have heard them, we had ^a^d the like things, had we so inclined; it is but a song, and a fable of old m^n: Remember thou, how they laid, my God, if what Mahomet declareth be true, cause a shewer of fl^nt-st^nes to fall upon us, and rigorously chastise us; He shall not chastise them, when thou art wi^h them, neither when they beg pardon of him; Who is he that is able to ^inder God to punish  them? They are not in his grace, when they hinder True-believers to enter the Temple of Mecca; he protecteth only such as have his feare before his eyes, but most of them understand it not. Their prayers are very light, they goe hand in hand in the Temple, but shall one day feel the punishment of God, because of their impiety. The unbelievers that expend their wealth, to turne the people from the Law of God, shall have sorrow for their expence, they shall be infamous, and precipitated into the fire of Hell. God shall separate the good from the wicked, he shall cast the wicked head-long into Hell fire, and they shall be in the number of the damned: if they repent, he will remit what is past, and if they returne to fight against the Prophet, they shall be entreated as the first: kill them, to avoyd sedition, that there may be no law in the world, but the Law of God; If they forsake their impiety, God shall behold their actions, if they depart from the faith, know that God alone is your Lord, and protector. The fifth part of the spoyle that you shall gaine from your enemies, appertaineth to God, the Prophet, his parents, orphans, the poore, and to Pilgrims that are in want; observe what is above ordained, if ye believe in God, in what we have inspired into our Mahomet. Servant, and in the day, wherein the distinction of the good and the bad was knowne at the encounter of the The day of battell of Beder. two Camps: God is omnipotent, ye were in an high place, the nearest to Medina, your enemies were a farre off, by the valley, and the enemies Cavalry below you;See Gelaldin. had ye promised to give battell, ye had transgressed your promise, by reason of the great number of Infidels, but what God will, is speedily executed, he shall destroy such as are wicked, having seene that battell, an evident signe of the true mission of the Prophet, and shall give life to True-believers; he understandeth and knoweth all things, he caused you to see in a dreame your enemies in a small number, had he made them to appeare numerous, yee had feared to fight, but he delivered you from feare, he knoweth what is in the hearts of men: When he caused you to appeare in their view, he made you seeme few  in number, to accomplish his will, all things depend on God. Oh ye that believe! make an Halt, when you are in view of your enemies Troops, and pray to God with affection, perhaps you shall be happy, obey God, and the Prophet, his Apostle; if disorder and terror surprise you, you shall loose your reputation, persevere, God is with them that continue to doe well. Be not like them that went out of their houses with dissembled joy, and hypocrisie, and turne the people from the right way, God knoweth all their actions; The Devill caused them to find pleasure in their doings, saying to them, none shall this day obtaine victory over you, I will be with you; and when they beheld the two Camps in battailia, hee returned on his steps, fled, and said, I am innocent of the evill that you commit, I The Turks believe, that the Devill saw the Angels fight for Mahomet. see what you see not, I fear the omnipotent God, he is severe in his punishments. The wicked, and such as were weak in their faith, speaking of the True believers, said, These men glory in their Law: It was replyed to them, he that relyeth on God, shall find him to be more powerfull then his enemies, and that he is most prudent in whatsoever he doth. Thou sawest the Angels that slew the Infidels, they did beat them behind and before, and said to them, taste the torments of the fire which you have merited, God is not unjust to his Creatures. The people of Pharaoh were Infidels, and those that preceded them, contemned the miracles and Commandements of God, but he rigorously chastised them, he is omnipotent, and most severe in his punishments, he shall destroy them that alter the graces he hath given to the people, untill they have altered the grace he hath conferred on themselves. Pharaohs people were Infidels, their Predecessors disobeyed the Commandements of thy Lord;See Kitab el tenoir. but we destroyed them because of their sinne, we drowned them for that they were unjust; The wicked are like to beasts, they shall never believe in God. Such as promised not to assist the unbelievers, and violated their promise, had not the feare of God before their eyes; if thou meete them in a journey, separate thy selfe from them, their punishment  pursueth them, peradventure they will consider it. If you feare that any one will betray you, and be wanting to their word, receive no promise from him, neither promise him any thing, God abhorreth Traytors: Believe not that Infidels escape the punishment of God, returne with your whole strength to fight against them; the halters of your horses shall terrifie the enemies of God, and of you, and of other persons who ye know not, but God knoweth them all. Your expence for his service, shall be payed you, and no injustice shall be done to you; If thine enemies incline to peace, thou shalt doe ill to incline, as they, trust in God, he understandeth what they say, and knoweth whatsoever they doe; if they desire to betray thee, God shall protect thee; and all True-believers endeavour to unite their hearts; but although thou shouldst expend all the riches of the world, thou shalt not be able to unite them, God shall one day unite them, he is omnipotent, and prudent in all his workes. O Prophet! the protection of God sufficeth thee, and the righteous that follow thee. Exhort the True-believers to fight against Infidels; if ye be twenty assembled with resolution and perseverance, ye shall vanquish two hundred Infidels; if ye be an hundred, ye shall overthrow a thousand, the unbelievers are ignorant; but God will lighten your burden he knoweth your weaknesse; if ye be an hundred true believers, ye shall defeat two hundred Infidels; if ye be a thousand, you shall subdue two thousand by the permission of God, he aideth such as expect his succors with perseverance. The Prophet cannot be a prisoner, he shall establish himselfe on earth with advantage, over unbelievers; Ye desire the wealth of the earth, and God will give you the treasures of Heaven, he is omnipotent and wise. If God had not taught you his Commandements, yee should have suffered great torments; eat of clean beasts that he hath permitted you to eate, and feare God, he is gracious and mercifull to them that have his feare before their eyes. Oh Prophet! say to them, that shall be prisoners in thy hands, God knoweth what is in your hearts, he shall reward you for  what ye shall have lost, and shall pardon your sinnes; If you be converted, he is gracious and mercifull. If they betray thee, they betrayed God before thee, separate them from the True-believers, God knoweth all things, and is most prudent in what he ordaineth. Such as have believed in God, as have departed from the wicked, as have employed their wealth, and persons to fight for the Law of God, such as have protected the Prophet, and defended him, are all protectors, and friends to each other; you shall have no consideration of the alliance of the True-believers, that desert not the company of Infidels, untill they be separated from them. If they require of you succors touching Religion, you are obliged to protect them, except against such as have confederacy with you, God seeth all your actions. The Infidels protect each other, if you obey them, great disorders shall ensue, and many seditions in the earth. Such as have believed in God, as have deserted the wicked, as have fought for the Law of God, as have established the Prophet, and defended him against his enemies, are indeed faithfull and True-believers, they shall receive from God pardon of their sinnes, and exceeding great treasures. Such as having believed in God, have departed from the wicked, and have fought with you, are yours, they shall be the Heirs of their parents, God hath so appointed it, he knoweth all things.    CHAP. IX. The Chap^er of Conversion, containing an hundred twenty and seven Verses, written at Medina.  Reader, this Chapter beginneth not as the rest, with these words, In the name of God, gracious and mercifull; because these are words of peace and salvation, and for that in this Chapter, Mahomet co^mandeth to breake Truce with his enemies, and to assault them. Many Mahometan Doctors have entituled this the Chapter of punishment, or paine. See the Exposition of Gelaldin, and that of Bedaoi, and el tenoir.  A Letter Parent from God, and his Prophet, to the unbelievers with whom ye have made truce. Travell in safety the space of foure months, know, ye shall not render God impotent, and that he will lay shame upon your forehead. Advice for the people, at the day of great Pilgrimage, from God, and his Prophet: God approveth not the action of them that adore Idols, his Prophet is innocent from that sinne; If ye repent, ye shall doe well, if ye abandon the Law of God, know ye shall not escape the punishment of your crime; preach to the unbelievers, that they shall suffer grievous torments, except those with whom ye have made Truce, who fall not fro^ what they have promised, and that protect none against you. Observe exactly untill the prefixed time, what you have promised them, God loveth them that feare him: When the mo^th of He^am shall be past, kill them where you shall meet them, take them slaves, detain^ them prisoners, a^^ observe where they passe to lay ambush for them; if they be converted, if they pray at the time appointed, and pay tithes, leave them in quiet, God is mercifull to them th^t rep^nt. If the Infidels demand quarter of you, give them quarter, to the end they may learne the wo^d of God; teach them his Commandements, for they are ignorant. How should they have Truce with God and his Prophet? If they believe n^ither in the one, nor the other, except  them with whom you entred Truce in the Temple of Mecca? If they observe their promise to you, observe what ye promised to them, God loveth such as have his feare before their eyes* How shall they have truce with you? If they have advantage over you, they will respect neither your alliance nor confederacy; They will speak well of you, and contemne you in their heart, the greatest part of them are impious, they have preferred the riches of this world to the Commandements of God, and have hindered the people to follow his Law, as if they knew not what they did; they beare no respect to the True-believers, wherein they are exceedingly too blame. If they turne, and make their prayers at the time appointed, if they pay Tithes, they shall be your brethren in God. I teach the mysteries of faith to such as have understanding to comprehend them, if they break their promise and disturb them of your Religion, kill their Captains, as persons without faith, they will perhaps put an end to their impiety. Slay such especially that renounce their faith, who have endeavoured to drive the Prophet from Mecca, and have begun to slay you, will you feare them! will ye be terrified by them? It is reasonable that ye feare God; if ye believe in his Law, fight them, God shall chastise them by your hands, he shall render them dishonourable, and protect you against them, he shall fortifie the hearts of True-believers, and expell melancholy, he pardoneth whom he seeth good, knoweth all things, and is most prudent in what he ordaineth. Think ye to be forsaken of God, and that he discerneth not them that have fought gallantly for his Law, from such as have adored Idols, and disobeyed his Prophet? The True-believers abandon not their Religion another time to professe it: God knoweth all your actions, Infidels must not enter into the Temple of Mecca, knowing that they are Infidels, the good works which they shall doe in this world shall be unprofitable, and they shall dwell eternally in the fire of Hell. They that believe in God, and the day of Judgement, that make their prayers at the time appointed, pay Tithes, and worship one God alone, shall visit  the Temples of his divine Majesty, and such as fear the creatures more then the Creator erre from the right way; We have ordained that such as shall bear fresh water to Pilgrims, and them that shall visit the Temple of Mecca, shall be in the number of them that believe in God, and the day of Judgement. Such as fight for the faith are not all equall in graces, and merits before God, he guideth not the unjust. Such as have believed in God, as have departed from the wicked, and employed their wealth and persons to fight for his Law, shall have a particular degree, and a particular place neer to his divine Majesty, they shall be the more happy. Go^ through his goodnesse declareth to them, that they shall enter into delicious gardens, where they shall remain eternally, there is with God a very great reward. Oh ye that believe! obey not your fathers, nor your brothers, that love rather to follow impiety, then the faith. Such as shall obey them, shall offend exceedingly; if your father, your children, your brothers, your wives, your parents, your friends, the wealth that you have gained, the fear of losing your riches, and apprehension of poverty, have more of power over you then God and his Prophet, and hinder you to fight for the faith, the Commandement of God shall be executed against you, he guideth not the wicked, and hath protected you in many occasions. Remember the day of battel of Hanin, when ye rejoyced in the multitude of your men, it did not advantage you, fear made you finde the place too narrow for flight, and ye turned the back as vanquished: Remember that God, at that time, put his Prophet, and the True-believers in a place of safety, and sent invisible Troops to chastise the Infidels, he pardoneth sinnes as seemeth good to him, he is gracious and mercifull. Oh ye that believe in God! Unbelievers are unclean, permit not that they enter into the Temple of Mecca after this year, if ye have apprehension of want, God shall enrich you with his grace, if it please him, he is omniscient and most prudent. Fight against them that believe not in God, no^ the day of Judgement, that forbid not to act what God hath prohibited,  and his Prophet hath forbidden, and that judge not according to the Law of truth, wherein they were instructed, who heretofore received the written Law: they chuse rather to pay Tribute, then to be converted, therefore are they contemptible. The Jews have said, that the Son of God is most powerfull; the Christians, that the Messiah is the Son of God; their words are like to the words of the Infidels that preceded them, but God shall lay upon them his curse. Consider how they blaspheme; they adore their Doctors, and Priests, and the Messiah also, the Son of Mary; who commanded them to worship one God alone, there is but on sole God: praised be God, there is nothing equall to him; they would extinguish the light of God with their mouth, but he shall not suffer them; he shall cause it appear, notwithstanding it be vexatious to the Infidels. He hath sent his Prophet to conduct men into the right way, to preach the Law of Truth, and to make it eminent above all other Laws of the world, against the will of Idolaters. O ye that truly believe! many of the Doctors and Priests eat unprofitably the substance of the people, and divert them from the Law of God: declare to such as treasure up, and expend nothing in pious works, they shall suffer great torments at the day when the fire of hell shall be kindled upon them, it shall burn their forehead, sides, and back; it shall be said to them, behold the wealth which ye have treasured up for your souls, tast the fruits of your treasures which ye have amass^d, When God created the heaven and the earth, hee ordained the year of twelve moneths, amongst which foure are priviledged. O stead not God, especially in those moneths; fight at all times against unbelievers, as they will fight against you, and know that God is with them that have his feare before their eyes. Sloath and forgetfuln^ss abound in impiety; God misleadeth thro^gh negligence the unbelievers, that prefer one moneth to another, in imitation of what is command^d: they permit to do what God hath forbidden, and delight in the malice of their actions, but God is not the guide of the wicked. O ye that believe! wherefore  have ye inclined to the earth? Why did ye prefer the wealth of this world to that of Paradise; when you were commanded to go forth of your houses to fight for the Law of God? The riches of this world are contemptible, if you consider those of heaven; if you leave not your houses to fight with the Prophet, God shall severely punish you, and put other persons in your places; you shall not protect the Prophet, God alone is his protector; he protected him when he went out of Mecca; he, with his Companion, they being both in a cave, he said to his Companion, afflict not thy selfe, God is with us; He hath defended, and succoured us by invisible troops; hee hath debased the word of unbelievers, and exalted that of true believers; he is Omnipotent and wise. Fight according to your power for the Law of God, you shall do well if you have knowledge to understand it; if you require the wealth of this world, honour, and reputation, they are not far from you, they follow you at hand, but the punishment of crimes and misery are as yet farre remote of Infidels; they sweare by the Name of God, that they were unable to go out of Mecca with the Prophet, in which they destroy their soules, for God knoweth them to be lyars: excuse them not, that thou knowest not them that spoke truth, and those that were lyars. True believers will not excuse themselves from fighting, or employing their wealth and persons for the Law of God; hee knoweth such as fear him. They that believe not in God, neither the day of Judgement, refuse to go with thee, they doubt the mysteries of Faith, but shall continue in their doubt, to their confusion; had they inclined to go out against the enemy, they had arms to perform it; God contemned their going out, rendred them negligent, and caused them to remain with the sick, the women, and children; had they gone forth with you, they had brought with them more of disorder then affection to the service of his divine Majestie; they hate you, neverthelesse you hearken to them: God knoweth them that are too blame, they hated thee heretofore, accused thee of all their mischief, untill, through the permission of God, the truth  appeared against their will: many of them said, excuse us, and scandalize us not, and they fell themselves into scandall and impiety: but hell is the habitation of those wicke^ persons; if good happen to you, they are discontented* if evill befall you, they say, they took heed to themselves, and foresaw it, and depart from you with joy; say unto them, nothing befell us, but what God had ordained, h^ is our Lord;See Gelaldin. all true believers are resigned to the will o^ his divine Majestie; say unto them, will ye expect, tha^ one of the two graces (either victory, or martyrdom) befall us? we will expect with you, untill God hath chastised you by our hands; expect, we will expect with you say unto them, expend through force or affection for th^ glory of God; your works shall not be accepted of him, because you are Infidels, your alms shall be unprofitable, for that you believe not in God, nor in his Prophet; y^ praise not God, but with negligence, and with regret fo^ what you spend for his service. Be not then amazed at th^ quantity of their treasures, neither the number of thei^ children; God shall make use of them to punish them i^ this world, and shall destroy them with their wickedness. They swear by the name of God, that they are yours, and are not, and fear to be discovered; if they meet with any Den, Cave, or House, wherein to hide them, they speedily repaire thither. There be of them that say, it is ignominious to give alms; if they give alms, it is with cholor if they gave them for the love of God and his Prophet* they would say, God is our benefactor; he will give u^ through his grace, and to the Prophet, whatsoever shal^ be necessary, our hope is in him. Alms are appointed fo^ the poor, for them that recommend themselves to God, to redeem Slaves, for such as are in debt, and necessitous God knoweth all things, and is most prudent in what h^ ordaineth, There be among them, who deprave the Prophet, and say, he shall understand what we say; say unto them, should it be to you a great advantage to hear well* The Prophet believeth in God, and teacheth true believers the Truth? the mercy of God is for them that believe in his divine Majesty; Such as detract from the  Prophet shall feel grievous torments; they swear by the Name of God, that they desire to content God, and his Prophet; it is reasonable that they content them, if they be good men; know they not, that such as transgress the Will of God, and that of his Prophet, shall be eternally damned? The wicked fear lest God should discover to the righteous the malice that they conceal in their souls, and that they contemne them; Say unto them, ye shall be contemned, for God bringeth to light what you feare. If you question them concerning what they say, they will answer for excuse, that they had no evill intent, and that they but jeast; say unto them, will you jeast with God, with his Commandements, and his Prophets? There is none excuse for you, ye are truly impious; if God pardon any one of you, he shall rigorously punish such as persist to offend him. The wicked teach among them impiety to their posterity, they depart from the truth; they goe hand in hand, and agree to disobey God; they forget God, and God forgetteth them; he hath prepared hell for them, where they shall remain eternally; he hath cursed them, and they shall feel the torment of infinite pains. The wicked that were before you, shall undergo them like you, they were more powerfull then you, they possessed store of wealth, and had many children, they possessed part of their substance, and ye possesse yours, as did your predecessors; ye were plunged in impiety, as they were plunged, but the good works that they have done in this world, shall be to them unprofitable, and at the day of Judgement, they shall be in the number of the miserable. Have they not known the History of their Predecessors, the History of the people of Noah, of Aad, of Temod, of Abraham, and the cities that were subverted? The Prophets preached to them the Commandements of God, who did to them no injustice; they drew affliction on themselves, through the enormitie of their crimes. The true believers mutually obey each other; they command to do what things are honest, prohibit to act what is not approved; they make their prayers at the time appointed, distribute tithes, obey God and his Prophet;  God shall remit to them their sins, he is Omnipotent, and hath promised to them gardens, wherein flow many rivers, and an habitation full of content in Eden; he hath promised them his grace, which is the perfection of felicitie. O Prophet! fight against the Infidels, fortifie thy self against them, hell shall be their habitation; they shall swear by the Name of God, that they have not traduced thee; nevertheless they have detracted and uttered words full of impietie: they have denied to have been enriched through the grace of God, and of his Prophet; if they turn, they shall do well; if they abandon the Faith, God shall punish them in this world, and in the other, with grievous torments, and on earth they shall find no protector; there be of them, who have inclined to capitulate with God, and have said, if God doth good to us, we will believe in him; when he did good to them, they were niggards, and avaritious; they have erred, and disobeyed his Commandements, but he chastised them, because of their impiety; he hath imprinted it in their hearts untill the day of Judgement, for that they have disobeyed him, because they violated their promises, and by reason of their lies; know they not that God understandeth what they conceale in their hearts? and that he knoweth what is present, past, and future? There be of them, who deride the true believers, that give almes according to their power; God shall deride them, and they shall feel the rigour of eternall pains; implore pardon for them, or implore it not, when thou shalt beg sixty and ten times pardon for them, God shall not pardon them, because they are ingratefull towards him, and his Prophet, God doth not guide them that disobey him; they rejoyced to be left behinde the Prophet, when he went to fight for the Service of God, they had an aversion to fight, and employ their persons and goods for the Service of his divi^e Majestie; they said, we will not go out of our houses with this heat; say to them, hell is much more hot, could you comprehend; they shall laugh at a little in this world, and shall weep much in the other, for a punishment of their sins. If thou meet them, and they demand permission  to go out with thee, to fight for the Faith; say to them, you shall not go out, neither shall ye ever fight against the enemy with me, ye were slothfull and cowards the first time, remain with the unbelievers; pray not for them after their death, and stay not at their Tombs, because they believed neither in God, nor his Prophet, and died in their wickednesse. Be thou not astonished, neither at the abundance of their wealth, nor the number of their children, God will make use of them, to chastise them in this world, and will destro^ them in their impiety. When command was sent to them to believe in God, and fight with his Prophet, the most powerfull among them desired thee to excuse them, and said, Leave us with them that continue in their houses, and desire to remain with the sick, the women, and little children: God hardened their hearts, and they shall never learn the truth. The Prophet and true believers that were with them, and fought, and employed their persons, and goods for the Service of God, shall be blessed; he hath prepared for them gardens, wherein flow many rivers, with perfection of felicity. Some of the Arabians came to excuse themselves of going to the war, and such as renounced God and the Prophet, remained in their houses, but they shall rescent grievous torments, because of their wickedness; the sick, the impotent, and those that want means to be present at the war, offend not God in ab^ding in their houses, provided they be faithfull to his divine Majestie, and his Prophet. The righteous are not obliged to do but what is in their power, God shall be to them gracious and mercifull. Such as repaired to thee to fight,Benou Moc^en. and whom thou didst dismiss for want of occasion, did not offend God; they returned to their houses with tears in their eyes, with discontent, to have wanted means to employ in the Service of his divine Majesty; the war is appointed to such as intreat thee to exempt them that are rich, and have wealth to subsist, they require leave to remain with their wives and children, God hath hardned their hearts, and they know it not; they shall come to excuse themselves, when thou shalt meet them; Say unto them, excuse  not your selves, I do not believe you, God hath given us to understand your news, he and his Prophet likewise hath rendred your good works vain and unprofitable; ye shall one day appear before him that knoweth what is past, present, and future, he shall cause you to remember whatsoever you have done, and shall punish you according to your demerits. They shall conjure you by the name of God, when you approach them, to depart from them; depart from them, they are full of uncleanness, hell shall be their habitation, whe^e they shall be tormented for their crimes. They shall beseech you to love them; if you love them, know, that God abhorreth them that disobey him: The Arabians, who observe not the precepts which God hath sent to his Prophet; are ye more impious and ingratefull? God knoweth all things, and is most prudent. There be persons among the Arabians, who account it lost money that they expend for the Service of God, and protract their departure, to retard yours, and make you to attend; the wheel of misery is upon them, God understandeth what ever they say, and knoweth all their actions; there be among them who believe in God, and the day of Judgement; they esteem that their expence for the Service of God draweth them nigh to his divine Majesty, and they invite the Prophet to pray for them, God shall give them his mercy, he is gracious and mercifull to them that obey him. They that first arrived at Medina, the first of them that went out of Mecca, to depart from the wicked, such as were at the battell of Beder, and such as imitated them in well doing, shall injoy the grace of God, he hath prepared for them gardens, wherein flow many rivers, with supreme felicitie. There be Arabians about you, and in Medina, they affect impietie; you know them not, but I know them all, I will chastise them twice on earth, (to wit, through ignominie and death) and they shall feele in the other world exceeding great torments. Others there bee, that confesse their sinnes, and who doe good and evill works; peradventure God will pardon them, hee is altogether gracious and mercifull; take of their substance for almes, thou shalt render  them righteous and shalt purifie them, pray for them, thy prayers shall procure them the mercy of God, he understandeth and knoweth all things. Know they not, that God accepteth the conversion of his Creatures, that their almes are pleasing to him, and that he is gracious and mercifull? Say unto them, doe what shall please you; God, his Prophet, and the True-believers shall see what you do, you shall one day appear before him, who knoweth the present, past, and future; he shall make you to know whatsoever ye have done* and shall chastise you after your demerits. There be others that attend the pleasure of God, either his grace, or his wrath, his punishment, or his mercy, God understandeth what is in their soules, and is most wise. They that esteemed, that the Temple built by unbelievers, to seduce the righteous, to distinguish the wicked from the good, and to observe such as had before fought against God, and against his Prophet, is the Temple of his divine Majestie, sweare that they desire to do well, and that their intention is most honest, but they are lyars, and God shall be witnesse of their falshood; make not thy prayers in that Temple, make the prayers in the Temple founded on the fear of God, that is reasonable; there be persons in that Temple who desire to be purified, God loveth such as have a clean soul; Who is he that buildeth best, he that foundeth his bullding upon the fear of God, or he who layeth the foundation of his building upon the brink of a ditch of sand, which falleth, and ruineth it self? They who esteem the Temple built by unbelievers, to seduce the people, to be the Temple of God, shall be with that Temple, and with the Infidels that built it, burnt in the fire of Hell; God guideth not the unjust, their building shall serve only to torment them, God knoweth their designe, and is most wise; he purchaseth of True-believers their souls and goods; and giveth them Paradise; if they be slain, or if they slay when they shall fight for the faith, they shall have what he hath promised to them in the Old Testament, the Gospel, and in the Alcoran: Who better satisfieth what hee hath promised, then  God, Declare to them, that they have made a good purchase, they have gained the height of felicity. Such as are firme in their faith, who pray, honour, and worship God, who observe his Commandements, and all True-believers, shall enjoy the delights of Paradise, with all manner of content. The Prophet, and True-believers ought not to ask pardon of God for Infidels, notwithstanding they be their parents, having had knowledge that they are damned, because of their infidelity. Abraham prayed not for his father, untill he had promised him to adore one God alone; when hee knew his father to be an enemie to God, he declared himselfe an enemy to his sin, he ceased praying for him, although he was exceeding charitable, and patient in his afflictions. God misleadeth not them that he hath put into the right way, he giveth them to understand what they ought to doe, he knoweth them that deserve to be seduced, and such as merit to be guided through the right way. The Kingdome of heaven and Earth is Gods, he giveth life and death to whom he seeth good: Who, except God shall protect you? he hath given his grace to the Prophet, and to such as followed him in his affliction, although it wanted but a little, that the hearts of many of them inclined not to the party of the unbelievers, but he pardoned them; he hath been gracious and mercifull to three persons who deserted the Prophet, and were sorry for their error, they knew there was no sure refuge, but in God, he pardoned them, when they were converted,Kiab bin Malik, h^lal bin A^ihe, Mesrarhe bin ^abin. he is gracious and mercifull to such as repent. Oh ye that believe! feare God, be righteous; the Inhabitants of Medina and the Arabians, that dwell about that City, ought not to contradict the will of the Prophet of God, neither dislike what he approveth, because they have endured neither thirst, nor paine, nor anguish for the service of his divine Majesty; they have not been trampled under-foot by their enemies, they shall irritate the Infidels, and shall receive no displeasure; on the contrary, they shall acquire merit, and perform a good work. God doth not deprive them of recompence  that doe well, he shall write down their expence for his service, and the number of the Idols that they shall destroy, for reward of their good works. It is not necessary that all the faithfull goe to the warre, it is sufficient, that of every lineage, and of every Nation there goe a party, while the rest shall learn the Lawes and mysteries of faith, to instruct their Companions, when they shall return from their voyage, perhaps they will fear the chastisement of God. Oh ye that believe in God* fight against them that would cause you to be defiled in impiety, be valiant, and know that God is with them that have his feare before their eyes. When God caused to descend from Heaven, any Chapter of the Alcoran, some of them said, through disdaine, that will increase the faith of this people. Certainly it augmenteth the faith of True-believers, it rejoyceth them* and enflameth the wrath of his divine Majesty upon Infidels, who persist in their pollutions, and dye in their wickednesse. They know not that God tryeth the good, once, or twice a year, they will not be converted, it is lost time to preach to them. When God sent from Heaven any Chapter of the Alcoran, they beheld each others, and said, doth any one see us? They returned in their impiety, and God turned their heart from the right way, for that they would not learn the Truth. God hath sent you a Prophet of your own Nation, who, with passion, desireth to deliver you from your obstinacy, and is extreamly affected to instruct you in the way of Salvation, God is milde, and pitifull towards True-believers. If they abandon the faith, say unto them, God is my protector, there is but one sole God, I recommend my selfe to the will of his divine Majesty, he is the Lord of the Majestique Throne.    CHAP. X. The Chapter of Jonas, containing an hundred and nine verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull; I am God the mercifull. The precepts contained in this Book proceed from the Omnipotent: Doth the people wonder that we have inspired a man to preach to the wicked the torments of Hell, and to declare to True-believers, that they shall finde true what their Lord to them hath promised? The wicked say, that it is but sorcery and enchantment. Certainly God is your Lord, who created Heaven and Earth in six dayes, and sitteth on his Throne, disposing all things; no man intercedeth for his Neighbour without his permission; he is your God and your Lord, worship him alone, will ye not consider it? you all shall be one day assembled before him; he promised with truth, that he will cause men to die, and raise them again, to recompence such as have believed in his Law, and done good works: The unbelievers shall drink a boyling drink, and shall endure great torments, because of their impiety. He it is that gave light to the Sun, and brightness to the Moon, that created the signes to know the number of years, the account of moneths, and of whatsoever he hath created, these things teach with truth, the miracles of his divine Majesty, to such as have knowledge to understand them; the difference of day and of night, and what God hath created in Heaven and in Earth, are marks of his unity to them that have his fear before their eyes. They who believe there is no resurrection, such as place their content in the wealth of this world, they that trust in their riches, and that are ignorant of the commandements of God, shal be precipitated into the fire of Hell, because of their sins, and the True-believers shall be conducted by his divine Majesty into delicious gardens, wherin flow many rivers, they shall there find whatsoever they shall desire, and shal say at the beginning of their prayers, praised be God;  afterwards they shall say, Salvation be to God; and at the end of their prayers, prayse be to God, Lord of the Universe. Although God doth sometimes suddenly chastise men, he alwayes attendeth the time of their Destiny. I will leave them that shall not believe in the Resurrection, in their errors, to their confusion; When man is afflicted, he invoketh us standing, sitting, lying, and in all postures, and when we have delivered him from his affliction, he persisteth in his wickedness. It seemeth good to the wicked to do in this manner, we destroyed their Predecessors when they believed not in the Prophets, neither obeyed the precepts that we sent them, and have established you on the Earth in their place after them, to see your deportments. When thou teachest our commandements to them that believe not in the Resurrection; they say, that the precepts of the Alcoran are altogether contrary to what thou preachest, and that thou hast altered them; Say unto them, I have no will to alter them of my selfe, I do but what is inspired into me of God, I fear to be punished at the day of Judgement, should I disobey his divine Majesty; Say unto them, Had it pleased God, I had neither read, nor taught you his Commandements, I sojourned a long time with you, before I taught you, will you not learn them? Who is more unjust then hee that blasphemeth? God doth not aid the Infidels that worship what can neither benefit nor hurt them, and say, their Idols shall intercede for them; will you instruct God in any thing that he knoweth not, of what is in Heaven or in Earth? Praised be God, he hath no companion. Men were all of one Religion before Infidelity took place, and if God had not said that he would deferre the punishment of the wicked untill the day of Judgement, he had already destroyed them in this world, because of their impiety; They say, We will not believe in the Prophet, if God make not some miracles to appear in him; Say unto them, God knoweth what shall be; expect, I will expect with you: when we gave them to taste of content after their affliction, they had subtilty upon our Commandements: Say unto them, God is  more subtile then you, his Messengers shall write your subtilties; he it is that made men to travell upon the earth and sea; It is he that sendeth them a favourable winde to rejoyce them in their ships; when tempest surpriseth them, they believe that the waves will overwhelm them, then they invoke God, with desire to embrace his Law, and say, if God doth deliver us from this danger, wee will believe in his Unity, and return him thanks for this mercy; and being delivered from perill, persist in their wickedness. O people! you draw mischief on your selves, you require nothing but the wealth of this world, you all shall appear before us to be judged according to your works; the life of the world is like to the rain, which we cause to descend from Heaven, it causeth with mixture all sorts of herbage to spring forth, for the nourishment of men, and beasts. When the Earth is adorned with flowers, and enriched with its fruits, the Inhabitants oftentimes believe they have the power to cause their production; then send we our chastisements day and night upon the Earth, and render it as mown, and as if the day before it had brought no fruit. Thus do I discover mysteries to such as have knowledge to comprehend them. They beg their salvation of God; he saveth and putteth in the way of salvation whom it pleaseth him. He shall not cover the visage of them that have done good works, they shall appear without shame, and dwell in Paradise; where they shall remain eternally; and such as shall have done evill shall be punished after their demerits, they shall be covered with shame, and none shall be able to protect them, they shall be as if a great part of the obscurity of the night had covered their countenance, they shall be condemned to the fire of hell, where they shall dwell eternally. Think on the day, wherein we will assemble all the world, and will say to the Infidels, hell shall be your habitation; where be the Idols you adored? we have separated you from each other. Their Idols shall say to them, you have not worshipped us, God is witness; was there any thing between us and you, that rendred us ignorant of your adorations? That day shall  every one see what he hath done, and know that God is Truth it self; their Idols shall be separated farre from them, and they shall understand their blasphemies. Say unto them, who enricheth you with the wealth of heaven and earth? Who causeth life to come out of death, and death out of life? Who disposeth all things in the world? They shall answer, it is God: Say unto them, why have you not therefore his fear before your eyes? God is indeed your Lord, what is there after the Truth, but falshood? How will you depart from his Law? his Word shal be accomplished against Infidels. Say unto them, Have your Idols the power to cause men to die, and to rise again; how shall they be able to blaspheme after these reasons? Say unto them, Are your Idols able to conduct you into the right way? God guideth the people into the way of Salvation; who ought rather to be followed, he that guideth the people into the right way, or he that misleadeth them? What reason have ye to follow the evill way; The greatest part of them follow but their own opinion, but their opinion is not conformable to the Truth; God knoweth all their actions, there is no falshood in the Alcoran, it confirmeth the ancient Scriptures, and perspicuously explaineth them; there is no doubt, but it proceedeth from the Lord of the Universe. They say Mahomet hath invented this Book; say unto them, come and bring any thing that resembleth it in Doctrine and Eloquence, and call the Idols which ye adore, we shall see if you are sincere; on the contrary, they have blasphemed, and have talked of what they understood not, when they heard the exposition of the Alcoran: Thus did their Predecessours; but consider what is the end of the unjust; There be among them, who will believe in this Book, and others that will not believe; Thy Lord knoweth them that defile the earth; if they slander thee, say unto them, I will answer with my actions, and yee shall answer with yours, yee are innocent of what I act, and I am innocent of what yee doe. There be persons among them that have inclination to heare thee, but art thou able to cause the deafe to heare?  Should they not be deafe, they would learn nothing; Others there be, who look towards thee, but art thou able to guide the blind? should they see clearly, they would not follow the right way; God doth no injustice to men, they doe injury to themselves, through the enormity of their offences. I will cause them to rise again at the day of Judgement, as if they had remained but one houre of a day in the grave; they shall know each other, and the w^cked who have not believed in the Resurrection, shall be damned: I will shew thee many of them whom I will chastise; I will cause thee to die before they be chastised, and they all shall appear before me to be judged; God is witness of their actions, he shall punish them according to their demerits; every Nation of the world hath had a Prophet sent from God, who hath judged with reason, and without injustice, the differences that were among them touching Religion: They have said, at what time shall the wrath of God appear? Say unto them, I, of my selfe, can neither procure good nor evill, if God doth not permit it; every one hath his destiny, when the time of their destiny arriveth, they can neither retard, or advance it one hour. Have ye considered the punishment which God heretofore sent, by day, and by night against the wicked? When ye felt it, ye believed it, and fell into it headlong. It shall be said to the wicked at the day of Judgement, tast eternall torments; shall you not be punished according to your demerits? They will ask of thee, if the pains denounced against the wicked, and if the Resurrection be matters of truth? Say unto them, yes, my Lord is most exact in his words, and all the treasures of the world shall not be able to redeem one soul. They shal repent of their sins, when they shall feel the punishment of their offences, but shal be condemned without injustice; whatsoever is in heaven and in earth appertaineth to God, he is exact in his promise, yet the greatest part of the world do not know him. He it is who causeth to die, and giveth life, and shall assemble men at the day of Judgement. O people! God hath sent you instructions, and remedies for your infirmities; he hath sent a guide to  conduct true-believers into the way of his mercy; it shall be to them of more advantage, then the treasures that they accumulate: Have ye considered the good things which he hath created for you? Ye have appointed one part to be eaten, and have prohibited to eate of another: Hath God permitted you to blaspheme against him? The opinion of such as blaspheme against God, shall be but misery at the day of Judgement; God is full of goodnesse for the people, but most of them are ingratefull. In whatsoever place thou art, whether thou teach what is contained in the Alcoran, or whether thou labour, I am alwayes present, nothing is concealed from thy Lord, of whatsoever is in heaven and earth; be it great or litle, all is written in the intelligible Booke, that explaineth all things. There needeth no feare for such as recommend themselves to God, they shall be exempt from the pains of hell. The true-believers who have his feare before their eyes, shall suffer no torments in the other world; it is declared to them on earth, that they shall have all content, the word of God admits of no alteration; they shall enjoy perfection of felicity in Paradise. Afflict not thy self for the words of the impious, vertue proceedeth from God, he understandeth, and knoweth all things; whatsoever is in heaven and in earth appertaineth to him: They who worship Idols, follow but their opinion, and are lyars; God hath created the night for repose, and the day for labour; such as heare his Word, find therein marks of his omnipotency. They have said, doe ye believe that God hath a Son? Praised be God, he is most rich, and hath no need of any person, he possesseth whatsoever is in heaven, and earth; you have no reason in what ye alledge; will you speak of God what ye know not? God doth not aide in this world them that blaspheme against him, he shall cause them to feele after their death great torments, because of their impiety: Instruct them in the History of Noah, how he spake to his people, and said, O people! if my abode with you, and the preaching of the Commandments of God, be irksom to you, know, that all my support is in God; assemble your Doctors, with your Idols, and conceal not what  ye doe; goe whither you will, ye shall find none to protect you; if ye contemne my instructions, I require not of you a reward for my pains; I desire to receive of none other then God the Omnipotent, and recommend my self to the Mill of his divine Majesty. They slandered Noah, then did we save him in the Arke, and them that were with him; we prolonged their posterity on earth, and drowned the wicked; consider the end of such as heard the word of God, and contemned it. We sent to them other Prophets after Noah, they made them to see miracles, and gave them most salutary instructions; but they did not believe in what they had no will before to believe. Thus I harden the heart of the wicked. We after them, sent Moses to Pharaoh, and his subjects, without miracles, they arose against our Commandements, when the truth was preached to them, and said, it was but Magick and enchantment. Moses said to them, will you say that the Truth is Sorcery? God doth not assist Magicians and Sorcerers; they said, Art thou, with thy brother, come to divert us from the Religion of our Fathers, and to be esteemed on earth? We will believe in thy words. Then Pharaoh commanded to summon the most skilfull of his Magicians; they being assembled, Moses said to them, cast downe what yee have a will to cast downe on the ground; having cast downe their cords and staves, Moses said to them, know ye none other thing but Magick? God shall render it vaine, and unprofitable; he abhorreth such as defile the earth, he confirmeth the Truth through his Word, although it be against the will of the wicked. Few men believed in Moses, because of their feare to displease Pharoah, and his Ministers. Pharoah was powerfull on earth, and in the number of the wicked. Moses said, O people! if ye believe in God, resign your selves to his will; they answered, All our confidence is in God; Lord, doe not thou abandon us to the malice of the unjust: deliver us through thy mercy from the hands of Infidels. We inspired Moses and his brother to dwell some time in Egypt with their people, and to make Oratories in their houses, therein to make their prayers, and  Preach to true believers. Lord, said Moses, thou hast enriched Pha^oah and his people in this world; they goe astray from the way of thy Law; confound their riches, and harden their hearts, they will not believe untill they see thy judgements, and feel the effect of thy wrath; he said, I h^^e heard the prayers of you both; be faithfull in your Embassie, and follow not the way of the ignorant. We gave passage through the sea to the children of Israel; Pharoah pursued them with hatred and envy, untill his people were drowned. Then said Pharoah, I believe there is none other God, but the God of the children of Israel, and I wholly recommend my self to his Will. Thou dost now believe in God, O Pharoah! and wert before disobedient to his Commandements, filling the earth with thy enormities, I have delivered thee from this perill, that thou maist be an example to posterity; for many among the people are ignorant of my omnipotency. We gave the Children of Israell to dwell in places full of delights, and enriched them with the good things of the Earth, they knew the differences that arose among them touching Religion, thy Lord shall judge them at the day of Judgement. If thou doubtest what we have taught thee, repaire to them that have read the Scripture before thee; what thy Lord hath taught thee is most true; be not thou of them that doubt, neither of such as derogate from the Commandements of God, thou shalt be in the number of the wretched. Those whom God will chastise, shall not believe in his divine Majesty, should they behold all the miracles of the world, untill they see the torments of Hell. The faith is exceeding profitable to the Cities that have received it; when the Inhabitants of the City of Jonas embraced it, we delivered them from our punishment, we delivered them from ignominy, and enriched them, untill the time appointed; if it pleased thy Lord, all the world should believe in him; wilt thou abhorre the people untill they believe in God? No man can embrace the faith with^ut his permission, he sendeth his indignation against them that disobey his Commandements: Say unto them, Consider all that is in Heaven  and Earth, miracles and preaching are of no use to such as will not believe; shall they expect what their Predecessors expected? Say unto them, expect, I will expect with you. I will deliver my Prophets, and the True-believers, from the torments of Hell, it is reasonable that I deliver them that obey my Commandements. Oh people! who causeth you to doubt of the Law which I teach you? I will not worship the Idols that you adore, I worship one God alone, who shall cause you all to dye; I will embrace his Law, it commandeth to professe his Unity, I am not of them that say, he hath a companion equall to him. Adore not what can neither benefit nor hurt thee, if thou doe it, thou shalt be in the number of the unjust. If God will afflict thee, none can deliver thee from affliction; if God will doe good to thee, none can deprive thee of his grace, he hath given it to whom seemeth good to himself, he is gracious and mercifull. Oh people! God teacheth you the truth; whosoever shall follow the right way, shall save his soule, and whosoever shall go astray, shall destroy it. I am not your Tutor, I do but what is inspired into me; I have patience in my perseverance, I wil expect the Judgement of God, there is no better Judge then he.   CHAP. XI. The Chapter of Hod, containing an hundred twenty and three Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God gracious and mercifull. I am the mercifull God. The signs contained in this Booke are most true, they proceed from the most wise, who knoweth all things. Worship ye but one God alone, I preach to you from him the torments of Hell, and declare the joyes of Paradise, that ye may implore pardon of his divine Majesty, and be converted; he shall give you an happy life in the world, untill the time appointed, and shall reward every one according to his works. I feare, lest you should be  chastised at the day of Judgement; if you forsake the right way, you all shall be assembled before God to be judged. The heart of the impious inclined to hatred of the Prophet, and they would have concealed themselves for some time from God; they are covered with their garments, that they may not be knowne, but God knoweth what is in their soules, he understandeth whatsoever they conceale, and whatsoever they make manifest. All the Creatures of the world live of his grace, he knoweth the place of their repaire, and the place where they must dye, all is written in an intelligible booke, that explaineth all things. He it is that created Heaven and Earth in six days,See Kitab el tenoir. his Throne was before upon the waters, (the Alcoran) exhorteth you to wel-doing. If thou saist to the wicked, that they shall rise againe after their death, they will say, it is but witchcraft and sorcery; if retard some time to chastise them, they say, there is no punishment for their crimes; but they shall not avoid it, in the day when it shall appeare, and they shall feel the rigour of the paines which they contemne. If we conferre riches, and health on the impious, and deprive them of them, they dispaire in their impiety; if we give them good after their evill, they say, misery hath forsaken them, they rejoyce, and become arrogant. Such as are humble and patient in their afflictions, and doe good works, shall obtaine pardon of their sinnes, and a very great reward. Perhaps thou wilt forget to teach something of what I have inspired into thee, and be afflicted, because they say that what thou speakest shall bring thee no profit. Certainly, thou art sent only to reprove them of their sin, thy Lord is omnipotent, and shall chastise them after their demerits. Assuredly, they will say, thou hast Controve supra. forged the Alcoran, and that it is of thy invention; Say unto them, come and bring with you ten Chapters of your invention, like to the Alcoran in instruction and Eloquence, and call to your aid the Idols that ye adore; if you be righteous, if they hear not your prayers, neither afford you succors, know then, that the Alcoran descended from Heaven, through Gods permission, and that there is but one sole God, wil yet not trust in him? I wil  bestow the riches and honours of the Earth, on many persons that affect them, and in the end they shall be confined in the fire of Hell, and the good works that they shall doe in this world, shall be unprofitable in the other. They who observe what God hath ordained, study the Alcoran, and believe that it proceedeth from his divine Majesty, to teach the right way, and to obtain his mercy, as before it, was the book of Moses. Such as shall believe in the Alcoran, shall be happy, doubtlesse the fire of Hell is prepared for the Infidels who will not believe therein, but the greatest part of the world is incredulous: who is more impious then they that blaspheme against God? Such men shall not see his face; the Angels shall say, at the day of Judgement, behold them that have been impious, a curse is upon them, and upon the unjust that have mislead the people from the right way, they were indeed Infidels. Such men shall not escape the punishment of their crimes on Earth, they shall find none that is able to protect them but God, he shall augment their paines, because they would not abandon their wickednesse, neither receive the light of faith. Such are miserable men, their Idols shall not afford them succors, they doubtlesse shall be eternally damned: and such as shall believe in God, doe good works, and be converted, shall dwell for ever in Paradise. The wicked are as deaf, and blind, and the True believers are like those who have good sight and perfect hearing; shall they be in paralell to each other? will ye never consider it? We sent Noah to reprove men for their sinnes, he said to them, worship but one God alone, otherwise I feare ye shall be chastised at the day of Judgement; The Doctors of the Infidels answered him, we see thee to be a man, like us, and that such as follow thee are poore people, blind, and without counsell; we perceive not that thou hast any grace, that ought to preferre thee to us; contrariwise, we believe thee to be a lyar; he said, oh people! know ye not that God hath taught me what I preach to you, that he hath given me the grace of Prophecie, and deprived you of it? shall I exhort you to acknowledge his grace, seeing ye abhorre  him? Oh people! I require no recompense of you for my paines, God will reward me largely. I desire not to banish True-believers from my company, they shall one day appeare before their Lord, but I perceive that ye are ignorant. Oh people! who shall hinder God to punish me, if I abuse True-believers? Will ye not consider it? I say not that I possesse the treasures of God, I know not what shall be; I say not that I am an Angell, I say not to them whom you contemne, that God shall enrich them, God knoweth what is in their souls; should I maintaine such discourse, I should have great blame. They said, oh Noah! we have a long time disputed together; if thou art sincere, let us see the paines which thou preachest to us; God, said he, when it shall please him, shall cause you to see them, you shall not escape them, my instructions shall be to you unprofitable; if God will prove you, he is your Lord, and you shall one day be assembled before him to be judged. Will the unbelievers say, that thou hast forged the Alcoran, and that it is of thine invention? Say unto them, if I have invented it, sinne will be upon me, and I am innocent of your blasphemies, God inspired into Noah, that none should believe in his words, but such as had already believed in him: He said unto him, build an Arke conformable to the inspiration that we have sent thee, but speak no more to me of the unjust, they shall be drowned; the passengers derided him and his Arke; he said to them, ye scoffe at me, I will laugh at you, and we shall see them that shall best understand; he whom God shall chastise, shall be covered with shame, and perpetually tormented. When our will was to destroy that people, and the light of the morning appeared, and the water boyled in Noah's pot, we commanded him to charge his Arke with two beasts of every kind and Species; all creatures were destroyed, except those, of which we before made mention, as well such as believed, as them that did not believe, and that but a few: Noah said unto them, ascend the Arke in the name of God, who shall cause it to swimme, and to anchor; the Lord is gracious and mercifull towards us. When the Arke began to flote, like to  a Mountaine, Noah called to one of his sonnes who stayed on the Earth, and said, my Gelalldin saith that he was called Kinan. sonne, come up into the Arke with us, and remaine not with the Infidels; he answered, I will ascend an high mountaine, that shall save me from the waters; Noah said to him, none is able this day to deliver thee from the punishment of God, if it be not through his mercy; The waters being risen, he was in the number of them that were drowned: God commanded the Earth to drinke its water, and the Heavens to poure downe no more raine; the water diminished upon the Earth, after the people were drowned, and the Arke rested upon the Mountaine called Gioudy; thus were the unjust extirpated; Noah prayed to his Lord, and said, Lord, my son that remained in the waters was of my lineage, thou didst promise me to save my family, thou dost exactly performe thy promise, thou art true in thy words, and most just in thine actions: Oh Noah! answered ^od, that son is not of thy lineage, he hath offended me, and disobeyed my Commandements, doe not enquire of me concerning that which thou oughtest not to know, otherwise thou shalt be in the number of the ignorant: Lord, said Noah, I will take heed, through thine assistance, to enquire of thee what I ought not to know, if thou hast not pitie on me, I shall be in the number of the miserable. God said, oh Noah! descend from the Arke with Salvation, and blessing upon thee, and upon a part of them that are with thee; I will enrich the other part with the wealth of this world, to punish them most severely at the day of Judgement. I teach what shall be, what neither thou, nor thy people have not yet knowne; be patient in thine afflictions, Paradise is for them that have my feare before their eyes. Wee sent Hod to the people of Aad, his brother; he said unto them, oh people! adore but one God alone, otherwise ye shall be in the number of Infidels, I require of you no recompense for the paines I take in preaching to you, he that created me, shall reward me; will ye never be wise? implore pardon of God, be converted, and obey his divine will, he shall send you raine from Heaven, and shall encrease your  strength, and riches, be not in the number of the wicked; they answered, oh Hod! thou shewest us no reasons to prove thy sayings, thy words shall not make us to quit our Gods, we give no credit to thy discourse, and tell thee, that some one of our Gods shall severely chastise thee; He said, take God and your selves to w^tnesse that I am innocent of the sinne that you commit, in adoring Idols; if you conspire against me, none shall be able to protect you at the day of Judgement, I recommend my selfe to the will of God, mine and your Lord, he conserveth all the cr^atures of the Earth, and loveth them that follow the right way. I have discharged my duty and commission, I have taught you what God commanded me, if you goe astray, he shall establish another ^eople in your place, you do him no harme through your impiety, he exactly observeth whatsoever is done in the world. When we destroyed that p^ople, we by our speciall grace delivered Hod from their malice, and all the True-believers that were with him, we delivered them from great affliction. The p^ople of Aad contemned the Commandements of God, and disobeyed his Prophets, they followed the will of the obstinate, were cursed in this world, and shall be accursed at the day of Judgement, because they disobeyed his divine Majesty, with designe to extirpate the people of Hod, his brother. We sent Salhe to Temod, his brother, and his people; he said to them, oh p^ople! worsh^p one God alone, he it is who hath created you of the dust of the earth, and filled it with many sorts of fruits, that you might inhabit it; beg pardon of him, and be converted, he hearkneth to his creatures, and heareth their prayers: they answered, oh Salhe! it was hoped thou wouldst have beene our Captaine, before the prohibit^on was made, to adore the Gods of our fathers, wee exceedingly doubt of what thou preachest; Oh people! said Salhe, know ye not that God taught me what to you I preach, and that he hath given me his grace? who shall protect me if I disobey him? You can but augment my paine, should I believe you. O people! this Camell, which God for you hath created,  shall be to you a miracle, and instruction, suf^er it to feed, and doe it no harme,The Turks believe that Salhe changed a rock into a Ca^ell. lest you be suddenly chastised. They th^ough contempt, wounded the Camell. Then said he unto them, ye shall live in your houses for the space of three dayes before ye be destroyed; what is foretold to you, is no Fiction: when we destroyed them, we through our speciall grace saved Salhe, and the true-believers that were with him; thunder surprized those Infidels, and in the morning they were found in their houses dead, extended as carkases, Thus did Temod and his people contemne the Commandments of God, to their disadvantage^ Our Messengers that came to Abrahams house, declared to him the birth of Isaac, Jacob, and their posterity; they mutualy saluted, when they en^^ed into his house, he caused rosted flesh to be brought to them to eate, and perceiving that they did not eate, contemned them in himself; and was terrified with their coming; they said unto him, feare not, we are sent to Lot, to extirpate the inhabitants of his City; Abrahams wife being present, began to laugh, when they foretold the birth of Isaac, Jacob, and their posterity; she said, ah God! shall I beate a son, I, who am old, and have an husband extreamly aged? this would be a miracle; they answered, are ye astonished at the power of God? O ye of the family of Abraham! God hath given you his bl^ssing, praise and glory are due to him in all places. When Abraham was freed from his feare, and they having announced the birth of his children, he disputed with them a long time, touching the inhabitants of the City of Lot; he was of a mild disposition; and frequently repeated the pra^ses of God. The Messengers said unto him, O Abraham! put an end to thy questions, the houre is come, wherein God hath commanded to destroy them, they shall unde^goe inevitable torment. When they arrived in Lots house, he was grieved, in that he was not able to secure them from the insolency of the people; he said, behold here a day extremly difficult to passe; The inhabitants of the City having knowledge of their arrival, repaired to Lots house to continue their filthiness: Lot said unto them, O people! I have two daughters, whom I wil give  you, feare God, trouble me not, abuse not my guests; is there none among you to shew you your error! They answered, thou well knowest that we have nothing to doe with thy daughters, thou knowest what we require; he said, were I of sufficient power, I would dwell in a fortified place to avoid the assaults of your malice: Then said the Messengers of God unto him, O Lot! we are Angels sent from God, those villains shall not approach thee, go this night out of the City with thy family, none shall look back but thy wife, she shall feel the punishment prepared for the wicked, they shall be punished early in the morning; be gone speedily, the day approacheth; when we destroyed them, we turned the City upside downe, and caused it to raine upon them stones, marked with fire, to confound them. Such chastisement is not far from the Infidels (that are in Mecca) We sent Chaib into the Country of Madian,See Kitab el tenoir, and Gelaldin. he said, O people! Worship one God alone; weigh with good weights, and measure with good measure; detain nothing from your neighbour, and defile not the earth, if ye believe in God, otherwise I feare you may be punished at the day of Judgement; the little that shall remaine, shall bring you more of content then all that ye can purloin, in weighing with false weight, and measuring with false measure. I am not sent to be your Tutor, but only to declare the word of God: they said, O Chaib, doth thy Law enjoyne us to abandon the gods of our Fathers, and hinder us to make of our goods what shall seeme good to us? thou art not of an humour good enough to be our Director. He said, O people! see ye not that God hath taught me what I preach? He hath given me wealth for subsistance: I contradict you in nothing but what is forbidden you, I will doe nothing but what is reasonable, and conform the most I shal be able to Justice; my whole support is in God, I recommend my selfe to the will of his divine Majesty, before which I must one day appeare. O people! take heed least ye become criminall, if ye forsake the company of the righteous, and lest that befall you, that hapned to them who would not believe Noah, Hod, Salhe, and Lot; the punishment of God is not far from you, beg pardon of him.  and be converted, he is mercifull and amiable. They said, O Chaib! we understand not all that thou sayest; we see thee amongst us without force and power; wert thou not accompanied, we would stone thee; thou shalt have no dominion over us. He said, O people! esteeme ye my company, and feare ye it more then God? Have ye turned the back towards him? He knoweth all your actions, live after your own manner, I will live after mine, you shall hereafter know your error; he whom God will chastise, shall remaine in perpetuall misery, you shall soon understand who shall be the lyar, you or I; expect the issue, I will expect with you: when we commanded to destroy them, we (through our especiall grace) preserved Chaib, and the true-believers that were with him; thunder surprized those wicked ones, and they in the morning remained dead, extended as carkases in their houses. Thus were the Inhabitants of Madian chastised like the people of ^emod. We sent Moses to Pharoah and his Doctors, with Miracles, with Arguments and Reasons most clear and intelligible; but those Doctors followed his will, and obeyed his commandments, notwithstanding they were contrary to reason; they shall follow him at the day of Judgement, as they followed him upon earth; that day shall they be accursed, and shall find none that shall be able to protect them: the punishment of Mecca shall be like to that I relate to thee; there be of its Inhabitants who subsist, and that do not subsist, and are no more; we have done them no injustice, they have drawn mischief on themselves, and their Idols have been of no use to them, but to augment their misery, when God hath commanded to destroy them: Thus hath God surprized the inhabitants of Mecca, he hath chastised them, because they were unjust; this shall serve for example to them that feare the day of Judgement; all men shall there be gathered together, all the world shall see it; I will retard it untill the time appointed, that day shal no man speakwithout my permission; there be that shal be miserable, and others who shal be happy; the miserable shal dwel in the fire of hel, they shal cry and complain so long as the earth and the heavens shal endure,  and so long as it shall please God, who doth as seemeth good to himself. The happy shall enjoy Paradise, where they shall abide eternally, so long as earth and heaven shall endure, and so long as it shall please God. Doubt not what the unbelievers worship, they adore but the Idols which their Fathers worshipped; assuredly I will chastise them as their Fathers were chastised. Moses preached the old Testament, yet did the wicked contradict his Precepts; had not God said that he will not punish them, untill the day of Judgement, he had already destroyed them, because they are in an exceeding great error; thy Lord shall reward every one according to his works, he knoweth all their actions. Observe exactly what hath been commanded you, with them that are converted; transgresse not the Law of God, he beholdeth whatsoever you doe. Incline not to the affections of the unjust, lest the fire of hell surprise you, and you be deprived of protection. Pray to God evening and morning, and a part of the night; prayers blot out sins; it is the doctrine of Preachers; be patient, and persevere, God will not deprive the righteous of their reward: He prohibited your Predecessors and their posterity to defile the earth; neverthelesse there were few among them that abstained; the unjust acted what ever pleased them, and were guilty before God: He shall not destroy Mecca, if the Inhabitants thereof obey his Commandements; and if it pleased him, the whole world should be of one Religion, they to whom he giveth his grace, transgresse not his Will, his Word shall be accomplished, and hell shall be filled with devills, and the wicked of all Nations. They have recounted to thee, and thou understandest whatsoever things are necessary for them, and what the Prophets have heretofore taught; thine heart hath been strengthened, they containe the truth, and they shall be for a lesson to true believers. Say unto Infidels, doc, on your part as ye shall understand, we will doe on our part as we understand, and attend the issue, we will attend it with you; whatsoever is in heaven, and in earth appertains to God, all men shall be assembled before him, worship him, resign your selves to his Will, he knoweth whatsoever the people doth.    CHAP. XII. The Chapter of Joseph, containing an hundred and thirteene Verses, written at Mecca. IN the Name of God, gracious and mercifull. I am the mercifull God. These signes are the signes of the Booke which distinguisheth good from evill. We have caused to discend from heaven the Alcoran, written in the Arabique tongue, peradventure yee will learne it. I deliver unto thee in the Alcoran, one of the best things that I have inspired into thee. Thou were before the comming thereof, in the number of the ignorant. Remember thou, that Joseph said to his father, My father, I saw in a dreame eleven Stars, the Sunne, and the Moone, I saw them adoring me. My sonne, said his father, discover not thy dreame to thy brothers, they will conspire against thee, the devill is an open enemy to men, thou shalt be elected of the Lord in this world, he shall teach thee the explication of Dreams, he shall accomplish his grace upon thee, and upon the lineage of Jacob, as he did accomplish it upon thy fathers, Abraham, and Isaac; the Lord knoweth all things, and is most wise. The History of Ioseph shall serve for example to posterity; remember thou, how his brothers said, our father loveth our brother Ioseph more then all us together, he is in an exceeding great error, let us kill Ioseph, and cast him into some secret place remote from us, his absence will render the face of our father more gentle towards us; after his death we will be converted. One of them said, you shall not doe well to kill him but cast him into the well, some passengers will take him, and carry him into an unknowne Countrie: They said to their Father, Father, wherefore doest thou not send Ioseph into the Fields with us? Wee will bee very car^full, hee shall sport and recreate himselfe; I feare, said hee, that yee will neglect to p^eserve  him; dost thou feare (said they) that a wolf should devoure him in our presence, and that we want strength to defend him? In the morning they led him with them, and cast him into a Well. We inspired him to prophesie to them what should befall them for the mischief they acted, but they wanted knowledge to comprehend it; they in the evening returned to their fathers house, with eyes full of dissembled teares, and said unto him, father, we sported, and ran who should run the best, Ioseph remained with our baggage, a wolf came that devoured him; thou wilt not believe us although we speak the truth; then they shewed him his shirt, which they had sprinkled with blood; it is you that hath done it, said he, you shall answer it before God, he is my protector, and was patient, without lamenting. There past that day The Levantins well; a Caravan, a number of persons travelling together. a Caravan near to that Well, who desiring to draw water to drink, let downe a bucket, on which Ioseph took hold to get out; they gave him cloathes, led him away secretly, and sold him at a good rate for ready money; they would not kill him, in which they were honest men. He that bought him in Egypt commanded his wife to have care of him, that he might one day be usefull for their service, and be to them instead of a son. Thus did we establish Ioseph in the country of Egypt, and taught him the exposition of dreams, thy Lord is Omnipotent, but few men know him: when Ioseph came to the age of manhood, we gave him knowledge and prudence; thus doe we reward the righteous. His Masters wife became amorous of his beauty, she one day shut him into her chamber, and solicited him with love; God defend me (said he) to betray my Master, and be unchaste (he was in the number of the righteous) and fled to the door; his Mistrisse ran after him, and to stay him, tore his shirt through the back: she met her husband behind the door, to whom she said, what other thing doth he merit, who would dishonour thine house, then to be imprisoned, and severely chastised? Lord, said Ioseph she sollicited me, that infant which is in the cradle, and of thy parentage shall be witnesse: Then the infant in the cradle said, if Iosephs shirt be torne before, she hath spoken  truth, and Ioseph is a lyar; if the shirt be rent behind, Iosep^ hath delivered the truth, and she a lye: then her husband b^held Iosephs shirt torne behind, and knew that it was extreame malice, and said to Ioseph, take heed to thy self, and beware this act be not divulged: doe thou, speaking to his wife, implore pardon for thy fault, thou art truly guilty. The women of the City, said among themselves, that the rich mans wife was amorous of his Slave, and that she had sollicited his love, and had erred from the right way, which she understanding, made them an exceeding fair feast, and caused Ioseph to enter the Parlour where they sate; while they carved their meat, they were so surprised, and entangled with Iosephs beauty, that they instead of carving their meat, cut their fingers. O God! said they, this is not a man, but an Angel; then said she unto them, behold him whom I loved with so much passion: she another time importuned him, to satisfie her desire, and perceiving that he would not condescend to her will, menaced him with the prison, and to make him miserable: O God! said Ioseph, I had rather be a prisoner, then do what she desireth, deliver me from her malice, defend me from inclining to her lubricity, and from being in the number of the wicked: his Lord heard his prayer, he understandeth and knoweth all things. This woman seeing Iosephs resolution, judged it requisite to imprison him for some time; he was put prisoner with two men, one of which told him that he had dreamed that he prest grapes to make wine; the other said, that he dream'd that he caried bread upon his head, which the birds did eat, they demanded of him the interpretation of their dreams, because he seemed to them to be a good man: he said to them before ye break fast, I wil interpret your dreams. I wil first tell you what God hath taught me, and how I quit, and abandon the law of Infidels, and embrace the Law of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, we ought not worship many gods; such as believe in the unity of God, are endued with his grace, but few men give him thanks. O Prisoners! who hath more power, Idols, or one sole God, who is omnipotent? The gods which ye adore are  but Idols, whom ye and your fathers call by such a name, as seemeth good to you, ye have no reason to worship them; God doth not enjoyn you th^s, he commandeth you to worship him alone; this is the right way, but the greatest part of the world, of this are ignorant. O prisoners! the one of you shall give wine to drink to his Master, the other shall be hanged, the birds shall feed on his head, the interpretation that ye have required shall be accomplished. He besought him that should be saved, to remember him when he should be neer to his Master; but the devill caused him to lose the remembrance of Ioseph, who remained prisoner, the space of nine years: At that time the King of Egypt saw in a dream seven fat kine, which seven lean kine devoured; and seven green eares of corn, with seven drie eares, of which he required the interpretation of his Doctors; they answered, that the dream was very obscure, and that they knew not the interpretation; the prisoner that had been set at liberty, said, that he would forthwith give the interpretation of the dream, remembred Ioseph, and calling him unto him, said, O righteous man! explain unto us what is the signification of seven fat kine, devoured by seven leane, and seven green eares of corn, and as many dry, peradventure I shall return to the King and his people, and they shall understand the interpretation of this dream. Ioseph said to him, yee shall sow the earth seven years following, which shall abound in fruits, preserve your Harvest in the ears, and take only what shall be necessary for life; after this, there shall come seven years barren, and unfruitfull, in which the people shall suffer much. The King of Egypt having learned the interpretation of this dream, commanded to call Ioseph; the Messenger said unto him, O Ioseph! return to thy Master, and require of him the meaning of the women who did cut their fingers, he hath knowledge of their malice, hath caused them to assemble, and demanded of them what was their designe, when they solicited thee with love; they answered, they knew no sinne in thee, and his wife confessed the truth, saying, she had importuned thee, but that thou art a very just man. Ioseph answered, by this it appears  that I am no traitor to my Master in his absence, God guideth not traitors; I will not say I am a man without sin, the spirit of man inclineth to evill, except such to whom God hath given his particular grace, he is gracious and mercifull to whom seemeth good to him. The King having talked with Joseph, entred him into the number of his domesticks, and made him superintendent of his All the revenues of the Crown. revenews, because he knew him to be a man of spirit, faithfull, and thrifty. We, by our speciall grace, establish Joseph in the Country of Egypt, where he did what seemeth good to him. I deprive not the righteous of their reward on earth, the recompence of the other world is yet greater for them that believe in my Law, and have my fear before their eyes. The brethren of Joseph returned to buy corn; he said to them, when ye shall come again, bring with you your yong brother by the father, you shall find I will make you good measure, and lodge well my guests; if you bring him not, there shall be no corn for you, approach not this kingdom without him: They answered, Lord, his father loveth him exceedingly, nevertheless we shall endeavour to perform what thou enjoynest us; he commanded his servants to put their money for corn in the bottoms of his brethrens sacks, perhaps said he, they will return, or acknowledge this favour when they shall come into their Country. When they arrived at their father, they said, Father, there is no more corn for us, if our young brother go not with us, if he go thither we shall have good measure, and we will be carefull of him. You will be carefull, said he, as you were heretofore of your brother Joseph; God wil defend him better then you, he the merciful of the mercifull. When they poured forth their corn, they found their money at the bottomes of their sacks, and said, our father, what shall we desire more, our money is restored to us, and we have bread for our family, permit that our brother go with us, we shall have better measure, that is a small thing to the King of Egypt; I will not send him with you, unlesse ye all sweare before God to bring him back again, if there be no great impediment. They swore to fulfill his will; then said he, I take God to be witness of  your oath: O my sons! enter not all together into the City, but go in at severall gates, to the end the people may not be jealous of you; God commandeth what to him ^eemeth good, I rely on him, all true believers ought to ^esign themselves to his divine will; they entred the Ci^y as their father enjoyned them, to content him; be^ng arrived before Joseph, he took his little brother by the hand, and said to him, trouble not thy self for what shall become of thy brethren; having filled their sacks, he causad a Cup adorned with precious stones to be put into the sack of his little brother; caused it to be given out, that they of the Caravan had stolne the Kings Cup; and sent men after them to search; those strangers protested they saw it not, and that they came not into Egypt to steal, that they were sureties for each other, and that he who had stolne it deserved punishment. The Cup was found in the sack of his young brother; he caused him to be apprehended, and accused them all of theft; Lord, said they, his father is old, he will be extreamly afflicted for his absence, take one of us in his place, thou shalt in the end find us to be honest men: God forbid, said he, that I should detain other then him who was found guilty of theft, that would be injustice; finding themselves out of hope to free their brother, they saved themselves in a secret place remote from the City; where the eldest said to his brethren, you know the oath we took at our departure, and how heretofore we intreated Joseph, I will not go out of Egypt without my fathers permission, God is most just, he shall dispose of me and my brother as shall please him, return to your father, and say unto him, thy son was taken in theft, we saw him, and endeavoured to our power to deliver him, they of the Caravan shall be witnesses. Jacob said at their return, they were the cause of that accident, that did not displease you; and he took patience, saying, God perhaps will favour my sons to return in health; he knoweth in what condition I am, he is most prudent in what he ordaineth. He retired from among his sons extreamly afflicted, and bewayled the losse of his son Joseph; had his eyes continually covered with tears, and he bore  in his heart great sorrow. His sons said unto him, Do^ thou yet remember Ioseph, to adde to thy grief, and hasten thine end? I am (said he) extreamly desolate, I leave all to the will of God; he hath taught me what ye know not. My sonnes return into Egypt, and inquire t^dings of your two brethren; dispair not of the Spirit of God, none dispaire of Gods Spirit, but the wicked. When they came unto Ioseph, they said unto him, The famine that is in our Country, hath extreamly afflicted us, it hath often constrained us to come to buy Corn; thou, of thy favour, hast made us good measure; thou hast caused our money to be restored for alms, God will reward thee, he recompenceth such as are Alms-givers. He said unto them, Ye remember what ye did unto your brother Ioseph: They replyed, Certainly thou art not Ioseph. I am Ioseph, said he, and behold my brother Benjamin. God hath given us his grace; he rewardeth him that hath his fear before his eyes, and is patient in his afflictions; he depriveth not the righteous of recompence. God, said they, hath poured his favours upon us in saving thee, whom we have exceedingly offended. Be not (said he) ashamed, God this day pardoneth you that sinne, he is gracious and mercifull; return to your Father, and bear to him this shirt, cast it upon his face, hee shall recover sight, and return hither with him, and with your whole family. The Caravan was then halfe way upon return, when Iacob said to them that attended him, I smell the odor of my sonne Ioseph; you deride me, but what I speak is most true: They told him, that he was still in his old error; some dayes following, one of his sonnes arrived with tidings of Ioseph; and cast the shirt that he had given him, upon him; and incontinently he recovered his sight, and said, Did I not alwayes tell you, that I knew what ye knew not; they said, Our Father pardon us, and ask the forgiveness of God for us, who have exceedingly offended him: He answered, I will beg pardon of God for you, he is gracious and mercifull. When they arrived before Ioseph, he took his Father by the hand, saying, Enter without feare into Egypt, caused him to fit  down, and his brethren fell prostrate before him. My Fa^^er, said he, behold there the interpretation of mine ^d dream, God hath rendred it true, hee hath favoured ^e, in delivering me from prison, and conducting you ^ther; he hath put an end to the jealousie which the de^ll had procured between me and my brethren. The word is liberall to whom seemeth good to him; he know^h what is necessary for his people, and is most prudent ^n what he ordaineth. Lord, thou hast given me wealth, ^nd knowledge to interpret dreams. Creator of Heaven ^nd Earth, thou at my protector, give me the grace to die in thy Law, and place me in the number of the righteous. This History of Joseph,He speake^h to Mahomet. is an ancient History which I relate to thee. Thou wert not with his brethren when they conspired against him; nevertheless, the greatest part of the people are incredulous. Demand no reward of them for having preached the Alcoran, it instructeth onely the wise. How many signes be there in Heaven and Earth, of the unity of God? yet the people believe not therein, and most of them adore Idols; assuredly God shall punish them at an unexpected houre, and in a time which they know not. Say unto them, Behold the right way, I call to the way of Salvation and Light, such as follow me. I return thanks to God, for that I am not in the number of unbelievers. We sent aforetime none but men to instruct the people, will not men consider what hath been the end of the wicked that were before them? Paradise is for them that are righteous; will yee not be converted? They caused the Prophets to lose all hopes of their Conversion, and believed them to be lyars; but we protected them, and delivered from their malice such as seemed good to us. nothing shall exempt the wicked from the punishment of their pains; they shall serve for example to men of spirit. The Alcoran containeth no blasphemies, it confirmeth the ancient Scriptures, and reacheth True-believers the way of Salvation.    CHAP. XIII. The Chapter of Thunder,See Gelaldin and Bedaoi. containing fourty three Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull; I am the most wise and mercifull God. These precepts are the precepts of the Book sent to thee from the Lord; it is a thing most true, but few men incline to believe it. It is sent from God, who raised Heaven without a prop, and with a column, that appeareth, and sitteth on his throne, disposing all things. He causeth the Sunne and Moon to move, until the day appointed; he disposeth all things at his will, and manifesteth to men the signes of his omnipotency. Peradventure you will believe in the Resurrection of the flesh. He it is that hath extendeth the Earth, raised the Mountains, caused the Rivers to flow, who created of all sorts of Fruits, the Male and Female, and covereth the day with the obscurity of the night. These things are signes of his unity to such as consider them. He hath created many fields of divers sorts, and Gardens filled with Grapes, and many different Fruits; he created Datetroes, thick as Groves, and Forrests, and others that are scattered through the fields; some are moystened with waters, and others have a more pleasing taste. These things are signes of his unity to such as consider them. Thou art amazed at the lies of Infidels, be astonished at their discourses; when they deny the Resurrection, and say, What, shall God yet once again create us of the dust of the Earth? when we shall be earth, shall we be a new people? They are impious, they shall have yoaks upon their necks, and shall remain eternally in the fire of Hell; they precipitate themselves into eternall pains, and contemn the mercy of God, so did their predecessors; but God is gracious to such as convert. Chastise severely the obstinate Infidels. They have said, We will not believe in the Prophet, unless we see some miracle to appear. Say unto them, I am not sent but to preach the word of God. He hath sent persons to every Nation, to teach them the right way; nothing is hid from him in the world; he knoweth what  women bear in their womb; he knoweth the time and period of every thing, the present, past, and future; hee is great and omnipotent. He understandeth what you keep secret, and what ye make manifest; hee knoweth where they be who cove^ themselves with the obscurity of night, and them that travell in the clearness of day; every one hath his guardian by his commandement, who observeth what he doth, and depriveth none of grace, that hath not offended his divine Majesty, and none can hinder him to punish whom it seemeth good to him. He it is, who giveth you to see the lightning which terrifieth men, and nourisheth his Creatures by the rain which he causeth to fall; he created the clouds charged with moysture, causeth thunder to make a noise, ^ar^eth the Thunder-bolt, and striketh whom it pleaseth him; the Angels tremble in his presence, yet do the wicked dispute his omnipotency. He it is who ought to be implored; the prayers of them who implore another God are ineffectuall, they are like to such as are very thirsty, and stretch forth the hand towards a Fountain, to which they cannot reach; the prayers of the wicked are impiety: Whatsoever is in Heaven, and in the Earth, the shadow of the morning* the obscurity of the evening humble themselves before God, through force or affection. Say unto them, Who is the Lord of Heaven and Earth, but God? who, except God shall protect you? your Idols can neither benefit, nor hurt you: Is the blind like unto him that seeth cleerly? is darkness like unto light? shall they adore the Creatures in stead of the Creator? God hath created all things, and is omnipotent, he causeth rain to descend from Heaven, and Rivers covered with Foam, to flow in the Valleys. The Gold, the Silver, and Mettals which ye melt to adorn and enrich your selves, are like unto froth. Thus doth God teach what is profitable and what unprofitable; froth suddenly vanisheth, and is of no utility to men: So falshood vanisheth before truth. Thus doth God speak through a parable, to them that obey him, and giveth them Paradise. All the riches of the Earth, and as much again, cannot ransom the Infidels, they shall be eternally tormented in  the fire of Hell. Who knoweth, that the truth contained in this Book, was not sent to thee from God? He that doubteth is blind; men of Spirit do not doubt. They who satisfie what they promise to God, who transgress not his Commandements, who have his fear before their eyes, who apprehend the day of Judgement, who are patient in their afflictions for love of his divine Majesty, who make their prayers at the time appointed, who give alms privately and publikely, and blot out their offendes with good works* shall be blessed. They shall enter into the Garden of Eden with their father, their wives, and families; the Angels shall visit them; shall salute them, and say, Behold the recompence of your perseverance, behold eternall grace. Such as shall swarve from their promise, and disobey the Commandements of God, and pollute the Earth, shall be accursed of God, and severely chastised; he giveth, and deprived of wealth, as seemeth good to him. The unbelievers rejoyce in the riches of the earth; but those riches are of little value, if they consider them of the other world. They say, If Mahomet doth not make some miracle to appear from God, we will not believe him. Say unto them, God guideth, and misleadeth whom it pleaseth him; he confirmeth the hearts of them that have faith in his Law; the Remembrance of God confirmeth the hearts of True-believers: Such as shall do good works, shall be happy. We have sent thee, as we did send other Prophets, to them that preceded thee. Teach the people what we have inspired into thee: When they, shall disobey thee, say unto them, God is my Lord, there is but one God alone, I am wholly resigned to his divine wil; my refuge is in his goodness. If the Alcoran should make Mountains to go, ^hould it cause the Earth to open, and the dead to arise, all would proceed from God. True-believers ought not to dispair of any thing, God shall guide all the world into the right way when it shall please him; and unbelievers shall not escape the punishment of their crimes. Thou shalt dwell with them until the word of God be f^lfilled: He swarveth not from what he promiseth; they derided the Prophets that came before thee, I prolonged the time of their punishment,  and in the end rigorously chastised them; and with what affl^ct^ons? Doth not God behold the actions of every man? They have said, God hath companions, to whom they have given names after their fancy; will you instruct God in any thing? The wicked take delight in their wickedness, and are gone astray from the right way. He whom God shall mislead, shall find none to guide him, he shall be affl^cted in this world, and yet more in the other. None shall be able to save him but God; Paradise is promised to them that have his fear before their eyes; they shall enjoy eternally all manner of content, such is the end of the righteous; and Hell is prepared for Infidels. They, to whom we have given the knowledge of Scriptures, rejoyce in the doctrine which we have sent thee; there be that abjure one part; say unto them, I recommend unto you only the worship of one sole God, who is the assured refuge of the righteous. We have sent the Alcoran in the Arabique tongue, to the end the Arabians may comprehend it: If thou dost follow the will of unbelievers, having had the knowledge of the unity of God, who shall be able to save or protect thee? We sent Prophets before thee, commanded them to marry, and they had children. Prophets cannot performe miracles w^thout the permission of God, and the end of every thing is written in his Book; he blo^^eth out, and leaveth permanent what seemeth good to him, he cannot alter. I perceive that some of the wicked have a designe to murther thee; thou art obliged only to preach to them, I will keep an accompt of their sins to punish them, See they not that their Countries and possessions diminisheth daily through thy conquests? God commandeth what pleaseth him, no man can escape his judgements, he is most exact in his acc^unt; their predecessors used subtilties as they, but God is more subtile then they; he wel knoweth the good and evil which every one doth: they shall one day understand who must have Paradise. They say thou art no Prophet, say unto them, It is sufficient that God is witnes of the truth between you and me; who is he that knoweth what is written in the Book of his divine Majesty?    CHAP. XIV. The Chapter of Abraham, containing fifty verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull; I am the mercifull God. That Book* We have sent it to thee to bring the people out of darkness, to guide them to the light, and the way of thy Lord, alwayes victorious and glorious; Whatsoever is in Heaven, and in Earth, is Gods; misery is upon unbelievers, they shall undergoe at the end of the world exceeding great torments. They who preferre the wealth of this world to that of Heaven, who goe astray from the way of the Law, and would pervert it, are in a great error, far from truth; The Prophets spake the language of them to whom they were sent to instruct them, God guideth and misleadeth whom to him seemeth good, he is omnipotent and prudent. We sent Moses with prodigies, to bring the children of Israel out of darkness, and to conduct them to light, he taught them the Commandements of the Law, to serve for instruction to such as shall persevere to do well, and shall not be ingratefull for the favours they have received. Moses spake to his people, and said, remember the grace of God towards you, he delivered you from the men of Pharaoh, who caused you to suffer great afflictions, who murthered your Children, abused your wives, and layed upon you great evills (sent from God, because of your sins.) The Lord hath said, if ye be not ingratefull, I will augment my graces upon you; if ye be impious, you shall be afflicted. Moses said to his people; if you and all men be impious, know that God will be alwayes glorious, and hath no need of you. Know ye not what befell (before you) the people of Noah, Aad, Temod, and their posterity, that none had knowledge of but God; because of their great number? He sent them his Commandements by his Prophets, they bit their fingers for anger, and said unto them, we renounce, and condemne your Doctrine: The Prophets said unto them, is there any doubt in the beliefe of the unity of God, Creator of Heaven,  and Earth? he calleth you to remit your sinnes, and deferreth your punishment unill the day appointed: They answered, ye are men like unto us, will you hinder us to adore the Gods of our fathers? Produce arguments of strength sufficient to prove what you preach; the Prophet replyed, Wee are men as you are, but God giveth his grace to whom seemeth good to him; we are come to you through his permission, the True-believers ought to trust in him; wherefore should wee not be resigned to the will of God, who hath guided us in the right way? we will continue in wel-doing, the righteous trust in his divine Majesty. Then said the Infidels unto them, we will banish you from our Country, if you be not of our Religion; but God inspired into them, that the Infidels should perish, and that they should inhabit the Land after them; that he would protect such as should have his fear before their eyes, and fear the pains that are prepared for the wicked. The Prophets were protected of God, and the obstinate wicked were destroyed: they shall be precipitated into Hell, and drink of water full of corruption, urine and blood, death shal appear on all sides before their eyes, before they have swallowed that drink; they shall not dye in that misery, they shall suffer yet greater pains. The good works which the wicked have done, are like to dust carryed away by an impetuous winde, they shall be unprofitable to them, and they shall be extirpated, because they depart from the truth: See they not that God hath created Heaven and Earth? that he can destroy them, and create in their place a new people, if it seem good to him? This is not difficult to God, all things are known to him. The more impotent of them that have followed the wicked, shall say at the day of Judgement, we obeyed you, wil you this day deliver us from the punishment of God? They shall answer, had God guided us in the right way, we had conducted you thither, we are alike miserable with you, we cry and lament in our misery, but finde neither refuge nor protection. The Devill shall say unto them, what God hath promised to you is infallible, I foretold it to you, I caused you  to transgresse his Commandements through my tentations, I had none other power over you, but to tempt you, you did me no harm, when ye hearkened to me, you drew mischief on your selves, I am not your Tutor, neither are you mine, I was impious, when heretofore I suffered you to adore me; Hell is prepared for you, and for all unbelievers, there shall they endure great torments, and the righteous shall enter into Paradise, wherein flow many rivers, where they shall dwell eternally, with all manner of blessednesse and content; Seest thou not how God speaketh by a parable? A good word is like to a good tree that hath taken root in the Earth, and hath raised its branches to heaven, and produceth its fruit in due time, through the permission of his divine Majesty; hee teacheth the people his parables, perhaps they will be mindfull: An evill word is like to a bad tree, that hath been torne from the Earth, there is nothing to sustain it, and it is without root, or fruit: God fortifieth the True-believers through his word in this world, and in the other, and causeth the unjust to erre, he doth what to him seemeth good: Seest thou not them that have changed his grace into impiety, and have made such as have followed them to dwell in the house of perdition? They shall abide eternally in the fire of Hell. They say, that God hath a companion equall to him, and erre from the way of his Law, Say unto them, ye shall have wealth in this world, but Hell is your Rendezvous. Say to the True-believers, who make their prayers at the time appointed, and give aimes in private, or in publike, that the day shall come wherein they shall neither buy nor sell, and where every one shall be recompenced for his works. Say unto them, God hath created the Earth, and the Heavens, he maketh the rain to descend from Heaven, which causeth to spring forth all sorts of fruits to enrich you, he created the ship, that through his permission saileth on the Sea, hee created the Rivers, the Sunne and the Moone, which move continually, hee created the day and the night, and bestoweth on you whatsoever yee desire, his favours towards you can neither be numbred, nor recounted,  nevertheless the Inhabitants of Mecca are alwayes impious and wicked; Abraham said, Lord protect this City, and make it to be the refuge of the world; Keep me and my Children from the worship of Idols, they have seduced a part of the people; he that shall follow me, and professe thy unity, shall be mine; if any one disobey me, thou art gracious and mercifull: Lord, one part of my Lineage inhabiteth Mecca, in a place unfruitfull, give them the grace to persevere in thy service, incline the hearts of men to affect them, enrich them with the f^uits of the Earth, peradventure they will thanke thee; thou knowest whatsoever is in the world, I know it not; nothing that is in Heaven, or in Earth is hid from thee; praysed be God, who hath given me Ismael and Isaac in mine old age, he heareth prayers when it pleaseth him; Lord, give me and my posterity the grace to persevere in well-doing, hear my prayers, pardon me, and pardon my father, and all True-believers at the day of Judgement. Think not that God is ignorant of the actions of Infidels, he deferreth the punishment of their crimes untill the day that all men shall have their eyes opened: that day shall they behold their sins before their eyes, and their hearts shall be full of desolation; If thou preachest to the people the day of Judgement, hath God (will the wicked say) preserved us to this present time, to do what thou dost appoint us? Say unto them, have ye not sworn heretofore, that there is no resurrection? Ye have dwelt with the unjust, ye have seen how they have been chastised, and how we have spoken to you in parables. Certainly they conspire, but God knoweth their conspiracy, their policie is to tempt the Prophet, to see if he will make the Mountains to move. Think not that God will violate what hee hath promised to the Prophets, hee is omnipotent, and avengefull. Consider the day wherein the Earth and Heavens shall change their face, and all people shall rise again; that day shall one sole God omnipotent, command men to come out of their Monuments; Thou shalt that day see the wicked bound in their chaines, their garments shall be full of pitch,  and guitran, their faces shall be covered with fire, that day shall he recompense and chastise every one according to his works, he is exact to keep account; This Book was sent to instruct the people, and teach them that there is but one God; the wise will remember.   CHAP. XV. The Chapter of Hegir, containing seventy and seven Verses written at Mecca. Hegir is a Valley neer Mecca.IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. I am the mercifull God. The signes are the signes of the Alcoran, which distinguisheth good from evill. How may the Infidels hope what the True-believers hope for? depart from them,See Kitab el tenoir. let them eat the substance of the poore, let them become rich, and content themselves in their hopes, they shall see one day what their end shall be; We have destroyed no City untill the time destined to its ruine was expired, there is no Nation that can advance or retard its destiny. The wicked have said, oh man! who believest that the Alcoran was sent to thee, we will affirme that thou art a Sorcerer, untill the Angels do assure us that thou are true: The Angels shall not descend to the earth, unlesse to chastise them, and they shall not be able to retard the time of their punishment; we certainly have sent the Alco^an upon earth, and will preserve it without alteration; we heretofore sent prophets one after another, the wicked scorned and contemned them; thus I imprint impiety in the hearts of the wicked, they shall not believe in the Prophet, and shall incur the punishment of their predecessors: should we open the entrance of heaven, and should they behold the Angels go in, and goe out at the shadow of the gate, they would yet say, their eyes were inchanted, and that they were bewitched: we created signes in heaven, and adorned them with Starres, to cont^nt the mindes of them that consider them; wee sheltered them from the assaults of the devill, but the Butterflie followeth every thing that shineth, and believeth  it to be a Starre; we extended the earth, and raised the mountains with proportion; we have made it to produce all sorts of fruits to sustain and enrich you; we have reserved in our pow^r the keyes of the treasures thereof, to distribute to them by measure what shall be necessary, we caused a fresh winde to arise, and sent rain to water them; it is not you that caused the fruits thereof to spring forth; it is we who give life and death, and d^spose of all things in the world. Wee know who they were that did procede you, and who they shall be that shall succeed you; I will assemble all at the end of the world to be judged; we created man of the slime of the earth, and before him the devill, of fire, without smoak. Remember thou, that God said to his Angels, I will create man of the slime of the earth, I will breathe upon him, to give him life, prostrate your selves before him; the Angels adored him, except the devill; God said unto him, wherefore dost thou not adore man? He replied, I will not adore him, thou hast created me of fire, and him of the mire of the earth: He said, get thee out of Paradise, thou shalt be banished, and accursed untill the day of Judgement. Lord, said the devill, lay not thy curse upon me untill the day of Judgement; he said, thou shalt be accursed untill the day nominated; Lord, said the devill, I will tempt all the creatures, because thou hast tempted me; I will cause them to disobey thy Commandements, except such as shall trust in thee, and recommend themselves to thy divine Will. God said, this is the right way, thou hast no power over the righteous who follow my Law, but only over the Infidels, for whom hell is prepared. Hell hath seven gates, and every gate hath its particular work; the righteous shall dwell in gardens, adorned with fair fountains, we will free them from all rancour; they shall repose upon beds like brethren, with respect, and affection, and shall be in eternall felicity: Declare to them that worsh^p me, that I am gracious and ^^^ciful, and my chast^sements are s^v^re and rigorous Preach unto them the H^story of the guest of Abraham, they sa^^ted him when they e^^red his house; Abra^^m was ^^^^ified  at their comming: they said to him, fear not us, we are the Messengers of God; we declare to thee that thou shalt have a son, who shall be a great personage: Do you tell me (said he) that I shall have a son in mine old age? why speak ye in that manner? We tell thee the truth, despair^ not of the grace of God. none but the wicked despaire: O Messengers of God! (said Abraham) what doe ye require? We are sent to destroy the Infidels, and to preserve the whole family of Lot, except his wife, she shall remain w^th them that shall be punished. When these Messengers came to Lots house, he told them, he knew them not; they said to him, we are come to thee, to cleare this people of their doubt of Gods Omnipotencie; what we speak unto thee is most true; cause thy family this night to go out of the City, and follow their steps, that none among you look behind him, and go whither you shall be commanded; the wicked shall in the morning be destroyed. The Inhabitants of the City came to Lots house to see those strangers; Lot said unto them, I beseech you defile not your selves with my Guest, fear God, and dishonour not your selves, behold my daughters, take them; They said, we do not hinder thee to lodge thy guests, and remained confounded in their drunkenness. In the morning thunder surprised them, we overthrew the City upside down, and caused it to rain stones with fire, that utterly destroyed it. This shal serve for example to passengers that shal see those ruines, and for a mark of the Omnipotency of God, to them that shall believe in his divine Majesty. They that inhabited the wood neer to Medina were impious, but we avenged us on them, they served for example to posterity, as did the people of the City of Lot. They that dwell in the Valley of He^ir, have defamed the Prophets; we gave them to see our Miracles, and taught them our Commandements, they contemned them, but they reposed in the morning in their houses built upon the mountains, and in their fortesses; when thunder suprised them, their treasures did not save them, and they were all destroy^d. We created the heavens and the earth to be signes of the Truth, and of our Unity: The hour of Judgment  approacheth; absent thy self from thy self from thy people with mildnesse,That is, the Preface of the Alcoran, containing seven vers^s. thy Lord who created all things, knoweth all. We taught thee seven signs, and the most precious Alco^an. Tarry not to consider the divers sorts of riches which the wicked possess^; affl^ct not thy self, if they persist in their impiety; Say unto them, I preach none other thing but the word of God, and the pains of hell. We will chastise the wick^d, as we chastised them that divided the Alcoran, who approved one part, and rejected the other. I am thy Lord, I will require of them an account of their actions, preach what hath been commanded thee, and depart from Infidels, we will preserve thee from them that shall scorn thee, as likewise from such as adore Idols; I know that thou wilt be grieved at their discourse, but praise and adore the Lord untill death.   CHAP. XVI. The Chapter of the Bee, containing an hundred and eight Verses, written at Mecca. IN the Name of God, gracious and mercifull.See Gelaldin. The chastisement of God is not far remote; desire it not before its time; praised be God, he hath no companion, he causeth the Angels to descend, and sendeth his inspirations to whom it pleaseth him; preach his power, and the pains of Hell to unbelievers; there is no God but he, fear him, he created the earth and the heavens, he is more powerfull then your Idols, and created man of the mire of the earth, neverthelesse he is obstinate in his pride* he created cleane beasts for your use, you draw (from them) great emolument, and advantage, to cloth and nourish your selves, yee see their beauty when they feed; and and when they lead them to pasture, they beare the burthen and whatsoever ye will send into Cities, what ye cannot carry without them, but with exceeding great travell; God is gracious and mercifull towards you; he created horses, and mules, and asses to beare you; he created many glorious things, of which you have not knowledge.  He teacheth them the right way, who observe his Commandements; had it pleased him, he had guided all into the way of his Law. He s^ndeth you water from Heaven to take away thirst, and causeth plants to bring forth, and trees that nourish your flocks; he maketh the Olive trees to produce, the Date trees, Vines, and all sorts of fruits. These things are arguments of his Unity, to such as consider them; he created the night, the day, the Sun, the Moone, and the Stars, that move at his pleasure, these things are signs of his Omnipotency to them that are wise; He created whatsoever is on Earth of divers colours kind, and species; he created the sea, which affordeth you fish, pearles, and other precious stones to adorne you; thou seest how the ships saile upon the waters, and divide the waves for the advantage of commerce, peradventure you will give God thanks for his favours. He raised the mountaines to make firm the Earth, and to hinder it to move, he created the rivers, and established way^s to guide you; he made the Stars to conduct you by night upon the sea, and the mountains to direct you in your way by day* who but he could have creat^d what he hath made? will you never consider it? It is not in your power to keep account of his mercies, he is altogether gracious and mercifull, and knoweth the secret of your souls: the Idolls that ye adore can create nothing, but are things dead, without motion, and know not in what time the world shall rise again; your God is one sole God; such as believe not the end of the world, such as deny his Unity, and boast of their false beliefe, are abhorred of his divine Majesty; when they are interrogated concerning what God hath inspired into Mahomet; they answered, that he preacheth Fables of antiquity, but they shall bear their burthen at the day of Judgement, who have seduced them from the right way, and have not known it. They that were before them were deceivers, God overthrew their habitations, the ruines fell upon them, and he chastised them; when they least thought of it; he sh^ll make them ashamed at the day of Judgement, and shall demand of them, where be the Idols for which they disputed against  true-believers? Such as have knowledge of Gods Commandements, assure that shame shall be upon the foreheads of Infidels, and that the Angels shall cause them to die, because of the enormity of their sins; They will say at the houre of death, that they believe in God, and are penitent for their faults, God knoweth what they have done; he shall command them to enter into hell, where is the abode of the proud: He shall command them who have his feare before their eyes to enter the house of Eternity, and the gardens Eden, wherein flow many rivers, there shall they dwell eternally with the height of their desire. Shall the wicked continue in their sin, untill the Angels cause them to die, or untill the day of Judgement? Thus did their predecessors. God was not unjust towards them, they drew mischief on themselves through their iniquity; they were chastised and felt the punishment which they had despised; they have said, had it so pleased God, our fathers and we had adored him alone; so spake their predecessors. The Prophets are not obliged, but to preach and instruct the people. We sent a Prophet to every Nation, to instruct it, and to command the worship of one sole God, and to quit the adoration of Tagot, and of Idols; God guided some into the right way, and others were seduced; consider what is the end of the wicked; if thou indeavourest to put them into the right path, thou shalt lose thy time, God guideth not them that desire to erre, they shall be deprived of protection at the day of Judgement; they have sworne by their faith, that God will not make the dead to rise againe, but he shall cause them to rise againe, to chastise them according to his promises; but the greatest part of men doe not know it, did they know it, they would acknowledge their errors, and the impious would acknowledge their blasphemies. When we willed any thing, we said, be thou, and it was! They that depart from the wicked for the love of their Lord, and shall convert themselves, shall be rewarded in this world, and yet more in the other, had they knowledge to understand it. Such as patiently endure the injuries of unbelievers, and trust in their Lord  shall be recompensed when they least think of it. We heretofore sent but men to preach our Law; ask of them that have knowledge of the written Law,The Jewes and Christians. if it be not true? We have sent to them the Alcoran, to the end thou maist instruct men in our Commandements, peradventure they will consider it. The earth shall produce nothing to them, that shall conspire against the Prophet, they shall be chastised when they least think of it; God shall afflict them in their commerce, they shall not escape his punishment, and their substance shall diminish by little and little before their eyes; God is gracious and mercifull to them only that honour him: See they not the shadow of that which God hath created, sometimes at the right hand, sometimes at the left, to adore his divine Majesty, they certainly are contemptible; whatsoever is on the earth, and in the heavens, beast, and Angels, worship God with humility, feare their Lord, and obey his Commandements. God hath commanded them to worship and to feare one God, alone, to whom obedience is due, eternally; whom will ye feare but God? who but God shall protect you? when evill befalleth you, you have recourse to his divine goodnesse; being delivered, some of you give him thanks, and yet believe not in his Law: You seek only the riches of the earth, but you shall see what shall be your end, they say that their wealth proceedeth from their Idols: by God! an account of their blasphemies shall be required of them; they affirme that God hath daughters; assuredly they deceive themselves, and are not well satisfied, when it is said to them, that a daughter is born to them; they fly such as declare to them the punishment of their sins, God shall leave them in igmony, and they shall be contemned as the earth which they trample under their feet; because they believe not in the day of Judgement, misery shall perpetually pursue them; God shall command for ever, and be eternally powerfull and victorious. Should God chastise men when they offend, he should leave no living creature upon the earth, he deferreth their punishment untill the time appointed, they can neither advance nor retard it; they affirm God to have that  which themselves are not satisfied to have; they lye, when they say that paradise is for them, doubtlesse they are erroneous, and shall be precipitated into the fire of hell. By God! we have sent heretofore Prophets to the people, the devill seduced men, and was master of the wicked in this world, but in the other they shall rescent great torments: We have sent thee the Alcoran, to cleare to men the doubts touching Religion, and to guide true believers into the right way. God sendeth raine from heaven to refresh the earth, this is an evident signe of his omnipotency, to them that heare his word; ye have yet a token of his omnipotency in the beasts that give you milk, to nourish you, and another marke in the fruits of the earth, in the fruits of Date trees, and the Vines, from which you extract wine, and receive profit. These things are signes of his omnipotency, to such as comprehend them. The Lord inspired the Bee to dwell in the fields, to lodge in trees, in Hives, and to eat of all sorts of fruits, it produceth honey of divers colours, that serveth for a remedy to the diseases of men; these things are signes of Gods omnipotency to them that consider them. God hath created you, and shall cause you to dye; There be persons among you that shall be full of ignominy in their life, to the end they may understand that God is omnipotent, conferreth benefits on some more then on others. Slaves have no part in the faculties of their Masters, neither are they associate with them, neverthelesse they associate to God another God equall to him, and blaspheme against his grace.) God hath created you men, and women, hath given you Children, and Children to your Children, he hath enriched you with the riches of the earth; Will you after this grace believe in your Idols, which are things inanimate, vaine, and unprofitable? Will yee bee ingratefull for the benefits of God? Will yee Worship what can neither benefit not hurt you? Believe not that there is another God companion and associate with God; Hee knoweth what yee know not, hee teacheth you a Parable: A Slave that is poore cannot give Almes, and  he who is rich giveth almes secretly and publiquely, as he seeth good; are they both alike? Ought they to be put in paralell? Praise be to God: Certainly, the greatest part of men know not his graces, he teacheth you a parable: Behold! two men, the one was borne deaf, and dumb, and given in charge to his Guardian, he knoweth not how to imploy him, he is capable neither of doing, nor speaking well, is he like to him that speaketh, that understandeth, teacheth men Justice, and followeth the right way? Whatsoever is in Heaven, or on Earth appertaineth to God, when he commandeth any thing, it is performed in the twinkling of an eye, yea sooner, he is omnipotent: He it is that causeth you to come out of the wombe of your mother, that giveth you hearing, sight, and sense, perhaps ye will return him thanks; See ye not the birds that flye in the Aire; who sustaineth them but God? It is an evident signe of his omnipotency for the True-believers, he hath given you houses to inhabit, and the skins and furres of beasts to cover you, he hath given you their haire, and wooll, to furnish your houses, and enrich you; he created trees and clouds to overshadow you, made the Mountaines and Caves to cover you from rain, created garments to defend you from the heat of the Sun, and the rigour of cold, he hath accomplished his grace upon you, peradventure you will resigne your selves to the will of his divine Majesty, and professe his Unity. If the unbelievers depart from the way of the Law, thou art obliged only to preach to them intelligibly; they know the grace of God, and contemne it, for that the greatest part of them are impious; preach unto them the day, wherein I will raise againe all the Nations of the world, and the Prophets and Apostles who have preached to them my Commandements, there shall be no excuse for Infidels, neither shall they find protection, or relaxation of their miseries: When they shall behold their Idols, they shall confesse that they were mislead, they shall understand the unity of thy Lord, and that their Idols are not able to intercede for them. God hath added to the punishment of Infidels, hath sent them evill upon  evill, because they hinder the world to follow his Law: Preach unto them the day, wherein I will cause to rise again all the Nations of the world, with the Prophet who preached to them, to be witness of their actions; I will be witness against them of thy Nation; I have sent thee the Book that unfoldeth the mysteries of my Law, to guid the people into the right way, and to declare the joyes of paradise to such as professe my unity. God commandeth you to do only that which is reasonable, he commandeth you to give almes, and do good to your parents, he forbiddeth whordom, disobedience, and injustice, enjoyneth you to do good, perhaps you will consider it. Perform what ye have promised to God, break not promised faith, ye call God to be witness of your promises, hee knoweth all your actions. Do not like the woman who spun a thred, foulded it, and afterwards entangled it and spoyled it, believe not that there is deceit and error in your Law; If the unbelievers be more in numbers then you, God permitteth it, to prove you; he shall clear to you at the day of Judgement the doubts that be among you; had it so pleased him, you all had observed one and the same Law; he guideth, misleadeth whom it pleaseth him, and will exactly require of you an accompt of your actions. Believe not that there is deceipt in your Law, take heed of stumbling; having once confirmed your steps, ye shall be severely chastised, ^f ye seduce the people from the right way; do not violate what ye have promised to God, for any price, his grace is of more advantage to you then the wealth of the earth, had ye knowledge to understand it; your wealth is perishable, and the riches of heaven are eternall; he shall recompence them that persevere in wel-doing, and whosoever shall doe good works, shall be blessed in this world, and in the other. When thou shalt read the Alcoran, implore God to deliver thee from the malice of the Divell, abominable to all the Creatures, he hath no power over them that trust in his divine Majestie, his power extendeth over such as go astray, who obey not him, and adore many Gods. When we alter any precepts (God well knoweth what he orda^neth),  they say thou art a lyar, but the greatest part of them are ignorant; Say unto them, that assuredly the Holy Ghost hath taught it from thy Lord, to confirme believers in their faith, and to guide into the right way them that professe his unity, and to anounce to them the joyes of Paradise. I know, that they will say that a man hath taught him the Alcoran. He whom they presume to have taught him, is a Persian by Nation, and speaketh the Language of the Persians, and the Alcoran is in the Arabique tongue, full of instruction and eloquence. They who will not believe in God, shall suffer great torments; such as renounce his Commandements, blaspheme against his divine Majesty; those that reject his Law, after having professed it, shall feel the effect of his wrath, and be punished for preferring the wealth of the earth to the riches of Heaven; God guideth not unbelievers. They in whose hearts he hath imprinted disobedience, those whom he hath deprived of hearing, and sight, are ignorant, they doubtlesse shall be at the end of the world in the number of the damned; he is mercifull to them that convert, and repent to have mislead the people from the right way and persevere in obedience to his Commandements. Be thou mindfull of the day, wherein man shall dispute against himself, and every one shall be rewarded according to his works without injustice. God teacheth you a Parable; Behold a free and Priviledged City, on the which God poureth his graces on all sides with abundance, and is ingratefull for his benefits; but he sent upon it misery, famine, and feare, because of its ingratitude. God hath sent to the Inhabitants thereof a Prophet of their Nation, they have slandered him, and were chastised, because of their sinne. Eate of what God hath given you, and give him thanks for his grace; if it be he whom ye worship, he forbiddeth you to eat of Carrion, of Bloud, and Swines-flesh, and whatsoever is not slaine in pronouncing the name of God; he will be gracious and mercifull to them who shall eat through necessity, without designe to offend him. Lye not, in saying, Behold that which is permitted to be eaten! blaspheme  not against God; such as blaspheme against him, shall not prosper in this world, and in the ot^er shall suffer grievous torments. We did heretofore prohibit the Jews to eat of what we have recounted to thee, we did to them no injustice, they drew mischief on themselves through their sinne; thy Lord is gracious and mercifull to them that ignorantly offend him, who convert, and doe good works. Abraham was obedient to God, and professed his unity, he adored not Idols, and gave thanks to God for his mercies; God elected, and guided him into the right way, he gave him wealth in this world, and placed him in the other, in the number of the blessed. We have inspired thee to follow the Law of Abraham, he professed the unity of God, and adored not Idols, he established the Sabbath among the Jews, of which they dispute; God shall judge their d^fference at the day of Judgement. Call the people to the Law of God with prudence, and preachings, and dispute against them with good arguments, God knoweth them that depart from the right way; if they evilly intreat you, intreat them as they shall intreat you; if ye be patient, patience is advantagious to them that take it willingly, have patience for the love of God, and afflict not your selves with the deportments and malice of the wicked, God is with the righteous, who have his feare before their eyes.   CHAP. XVII. The Chapter of the Voyage by night, containing an hundred and eleven verses, written at Mecca.  Reader, The Turks believe that this night of the Voyage Mahomet ascended into Heaven with the Angel Gabriel: he was mounted on a white Burac, which is a beast partly Mule, partly Asse, and partly Horse. He saw all the Prophets that preceded him, all the wonders of Paradise, and saw God, who sate on his Throne. See Kitab el tenoir, Tesfiir anf Giauhoir, and the exposition of Gelaldin. The Bedaoi intituleth this Chapter the Chapter of the Children of Israel.  IN the Name of God, gracious and mercifull. Praise be to him, that caused his servant to goe in one night from the Temple of Mecca, to the Temple of Jerusalem; wee have blessed that Temple, and whatsoever is about it, in token of our omnipotency. We gave to Moses the Old Testament, to instruct the Children of Israel, and to deterr them from the worship of any other God, but of me; to forbid them to adore the lineage of Noah, or the lineage of them that we preserved in his Ark.To quit their saith, and return to it of^en. Noah is my creature, and my servant, acknowledging my benefits; wee prohibited in Scripture the children of Israel, to defile twice the Earth, left they kindled too great a fire; when that befell you,See Kitab el tenoir. we stirred up our servants against you, and they entered by force into the midst of your houses; this was as soon executed as promised. In the end, we gave you advantage over your enemies; we gave you wealth, and children to succor you, and ye were more numerous then the Infidels; the good and the evill that you shall doe, shall be for your souls. We stirred up the wicked against you, because of your sins, to afflict you through the murther, and bondage of your persons; and they destroyed the Temple of Jerusalem, as they had ruined it the first time. Your Lord shall pardon you, if you convert, we have established Hell for a perpetuall prison of Infidels. The Alcoran guideth the righteous into the right way, it declareth to them a great reward, preacheth to the wicked the torments of Hell; and exhorteth men to weldoing, although they are inclining to evill, and prompt to sin. We created the day and the night, they are two signes of our omnipotency: we caused the night to passe away, and the day to appeare for labor; and to the end ye might know number of ages, of months, and of yeares: wee explained our mysteries without obscurity, and have enjoyned every one to beare the burden of his iniquities at the day of judgement; that day will we make men to see the accompt of their sins, they shall be recompen^ed and chastised according to the good and evill that they shall have committed, and none shall beare burden of his neighbor:  we sent to the people Prophets and Apostles to preach to them our Commandements, before they were chastised, before the destruction of a City: we advert^sed the principall inhabitants thereof; when they disobeyed us, we chastised them according to our word, and destroyed them. How many Cities have we ruined since Noahs flood? The sins of the people and knowne to their Lord; he giveth the riches of this world to them that desire them, to cause them to fall head-long into Hell, where they shall repent of their iniquities, and be deprived of mercy. He who shall labor to acquire the riches of Heaven, shall be protected of thy Lord in this world, and enriched with the Treasures of Heaven in the other. Consider, how we prefer our Creatures one to another* the reward of Heaven is much greater then that of the Earth. Believe not that there be two Gods, otherwise you shall repent of it, and be deprived of protection at the day of judgement. Thy Lord hath ordained to worship him alone, and to honour your father and mother, especially in their old age, and say nothing to them that may afflict them, neither vex them; speak to them with respect, doe not contemne them, pray to God to compassionate them, as they pittied, when they brought you up in your infancy. God knoweth whatsoever is in your souls; he will be mercifull to you, if ye obey him. Give to your parents what appertaineth to them, doe good to the poore, and to pilgrims, be not prodigall, the prodigall are brethren of the Devill, ingratefull for the favors of their Lord. Contemne not the poore, if ye desire to obtain the mercy of God, speak to them with mildnesse, and endeavour to content them; doe not entirely shut your hands, neither altogether extend them; if yee doe otherwise, yee shall offend. Thy Lord giveth, and taketh away his graces, as seemeth good to him; hee knoweth his people, and understandeth all their actions. Slay not your children for feare of necessity, I will give whatsoever shall be necessary for them; the murther of children is an exceeding great sin, flie whoredom, it is a thing uncleane, kill no man without reason; we have commanded  to pursue him that shal have slain his neighbour, but let not the heir sin maliciously, prosecuting the innocent for the guilty. The innocent is in Gods protection: take not the goods of Orphans, and be carefull of them, untill they be in yeers of discretion; satifie your promises, an accompt shall be required of you; measure with good measure, and weigh with just weights. Busie your selves not with that which you ought not to know. There shall be required of you an accompt of the sins ye have committed, in seeing, hearing, and thinking. Be not proud, ye shall never be so long as the Earth, neither so high as the Mountains; such sins are exceeding great before thy Lord: It is one part of what he hath inspired into thee, to preach to his people: Say not, there be two Gods, left thou be confined to the fire of Hell. Your Lord hath elected you, with all those men and women that obey his Commandements, for his sons and daughters, as the Angels; yet say not that God hath children. We made mention in the Alcoran of whatsoever is necessary to be preached to the people; say unto them, If there be a God with God, as ye affirme, invok him that hath his Throne in Heaven; praised be God, he hath no Companion, he is most high and great. The seven Heavens praise him, and all that is in Earth glorifie him, but ye comprehend it not, he is gracious and mercifull, We will separate thee from the wicked; we will harden their hearts, and stop their ears. When thou shalt read the Alcoran, and say, There is but one God, they will turne the back, and deride thee, I know what they desire to heare; they would have the people to hearken to the words of the unjust, who say, That thou art a Sorcerer, and a Magician; consider to whom they compare thee; they certainly are in error, and are not able to find the right way. What! we are (say they) bones and flesh, shall we rise againe, and become new Creatures? who shall cause us to rise again? Say unto them, Although ye be stone, iron, bones, and flesh, he who first created you, shall raise you againe. They shall shake the head at thee, and ask of thee. In what time they shall rise againe? say unto them, Peradventure  it shall be suddenly. When ye shall be called out of the graves by the Commandement of God, ye will believe that ye have remained but very little time in the world; then shall the Infidels confesse, that the Devill hath deceived them, and that he is their open enemy. Your Lord knoweth you all, he will pardon, or chastise you, as seemeth good to him: We have not sent thee to be their guardian; thy Lord knoweth whatsoever is in Heaven and in Earth. Certainly, we gave graces to some Prophets, which we gave not to others; and we gave the Psalter to David; Say unto the Infidels, invoke the Idols which you adore, and see if they are of power to deliver you from affliction. They that implore God, desire to be nigh unto him; who are they that shall neerest approach his divine Majesty they who hope in his mercy, or such as feare his punishment? Certainly his punishment ought most to be feared. We will destroy all the Cities of the world before the day of Judgement, and chastise the wicked with rigorous torments; this is written upon the Tables kept in heaven; nothing hath hindred us to manifest the miracles which the inhabitants of Mecca desire to see, but the contempt shewed by their predecessors. Tenod saw the miracles of the Camell, and contemned it; I will no more shew miracles, but to make the people to apprehend the torments of hell. Remember thou, that we have said to thee, that thy Lord knoweth all that the world doth; that which we gave thee to see (in the voyage by night) is to prove the people as the cursed tree,See Gelaldin. which is spoken of in the Alcoran; there be persons that will believe it, others that will not believe; but I will trie them to augment their confusion: Remember thou, that we commanded the Angels to humble themselves before Adam, and that they did humble themselves, except the devill; who said, shall I adore him whom thou hast created of the earth? who is he whom thou hast preferred to me? Certainly, if thou tarry untill the day of Judgement, I will destroy his race, except that small number that shall be under thy protection. Thy Lord said unto him, get thee hence, hell shall be thy punishment, and  the punishment of them that shall follow thee; deceive by thy speeches them whom thou shalt be able to deceive, seduce whom thou canst seduce with the wealth of the earth, cause them to exercise Usury, and commit the sin of whoredome; tell them, there is neither Resurrection nor Judgement; whatsoever thou shalt promise them shall be but vanity and falshood; thou shalt have no power over them that shall worship me, I will protect them against thee. It is your Lord, who causeth the ship to travell upon the waters, for the advantage of traffique; when the tempest chargeth you, your Idols forsake you, he alone is able to protect you, neverthelesse when he hath caused you to arrive at the Port, you deny his Unity, and follow your impiety; believe ye that he will another time make the sea calm to you? and that he will send you a favourable wind, if you doe not acknowledge him your protector; Believe ye to returne againe to the sea? He shall send you an impetuous wind, that shall overwhelme you, with your impietie, and ye shall find none to protect you against him. We have conferred on men many favours, we have ^onducted them on th^ earth, and sea, enriched with all sorts of riches, and gratified them above all creatures of the earth; preach to them the day wherein I will assemble before me all the Nations of the world, with the Prophet that shall have preached to them. He to whom shall be given the Book of the Accompt of his works in his right hand, shall read his accompt entirely, no injustice shall be done to him, and he shall be happy. He that shall be blind in this world, shall be so in the other, and shall not see the right way. They would divert thee from performing what we have inspired into thee, to induce thee to blaspheme against me. If thou do it, thou shalt be of their friends; were it not for the strength that we have given thee, they would make thee to incline to their impiety, hadst thou done it, we had given thee to taste of great afflictions in this world, and in the other; thou hadst found none to protect thee against us; it wanted not much, but they had affrighted thee at Medina, to cause thee to go out of it; had they driven thee thence, they had not continued  there long after thee. We heretofore sent our Prophets to instruct the people in our Law, thou shall find therein nothing to change; make thy prayers when the Sun shall set, at the beginning, and at the end of the night, and at the dawning of day, the Angels shall be witnesses of thine orisons; spend one part of the night in prayer, this shall be an augmentation of merit, thy Lord shall establish thee in the place of his glory: Say, Lord, into whatsoever place I goe, make me to enter, and goe forth with truth, give me thy protection; Say,See Gelaldin. that truth is come, and that vanity is vanished; this Book shall heal the people of their error, it shall bring them into the way of mercy, and encrease the misery of unbelievers. We have exhorted men to abandon their impiety, they have not done it, and despaired when they were touched with affliction; Say unto them, each of us doth after his will, and God knoweth him that followeth the right way; they shall demand of thee concerning the Soul: Say unto them, the soul is an effect of God, he hath given you very little knowledge; assuredly, had it so pleased him, he could have deprived you of the knowledge he hath given you, you shall find nothing that is able to protect you but his mercy? Say unto them, if the devils, and men were all assembled against me, they should not be able to compose a Book like the Alcoran. We have taught in the Alcoran whatsoever is necessary for the salvation of men, neverthelesse the greatest part of the people depart from the Truth, and say, we will not believe thee, unlesse thou cause fountains to spring out of the earth, and make in this place a garden, beautified with Date trees, and Vines, with rivers flowing in the midst, or unlesse we see, descend from heaven a part of the pains which thou preachest; we will not believe thee, unlesse God and the Angels come to thy assistance, unlesse thy house be of fine gold, and that we see the Book of Truth sent from heaven; we will not believe in thy Parchment, unlesse we see descend from heaven a Book which we may be able to read: Say unto them, praised be my Lord, am I any thing but a man sent from him? what hindreth men to believe,  since there hath been sent to them a Pilot to conduct them into the way of salvation? They say, that thou art a man, and not an Angel: Say unto them, should the Angels have inhabited the Earth, God would have sent an Angel to instruct them, it sufficeth that he is the witnesse of mine actions between you, and me, he knoweth and seeth all things; he whom God guideth, is well guided, and such as God shall cause to erre, shall find none to put them into the right way; he will assemble all of them at the day of Judgement, they shall be infamous, deaf, mute, and blind, and condemned to the flames of hell, because they are wicked, and have said through derision, that they are bones, and flesh, and that they shall rise againe as new creatures; see they not that God hath created heaven, and earth? that he can create yet more, and hath established a destiny indubitable, and infallible? The unbelievers are exceedingly too blame: Say unto them, should you possesse all the treasures of the world, yet would ye feare to make expence for the service of God; man is too avaricious; we gave to Moses nine marks of our Omnipotency, known to the children of Israel; Pharoah told him that he was a Magician;His hand, his staffe, the deluge, grashoppers, lice, frogs, blood, fear, and famine. See Bedaoi. assuredly, said Moses, these signs and miracles that thou seest, proceed from God, Lord of heaven and earth; I believe, Oh Pharoah! that thou forsakest the Truth: Then would Pharoah have driven him out of Egypt, but we drowned all those that were with him, and commanded the children of Israel to inhabit the land; we will assemble them at the end of the world, to reward them after their works: We have indeed sent thee the Alcoran from heaven, to proclaime the joys of Paradise, and to preach the torments of hell; we have sent it, to the end thou maist teach it to the people; we have sent it clear, and intelligible, that it may be understood, according to occurences. Say unto them, believe, or b^l^eve it not when, those that have knowledge in the written Law heard it read, they prostrated themselves on the ground with humility, and said, praised be God, what he promiseth, is infallible, and incontinently is his command executed; they wept, prostrating the face towards the earth,  and the reading of the Alcoran augmented their devotion; Say unto them, implore God, call God mercifull, all his Attributes are most glorious. Make it not appear to the world how often thou shalt pray, neither how often thou shalt read the Alcoran, and fear not to pray to God, and to read (the Alcoran) follow in this the middle path, and say, praised be God, he hath no Son, he hath no companion, neither protector to preserve him from contempt, his greatness is perfect and compleat.   CHAP. XVIII. The Chapter of the Cave, containing an hundred and ten Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. Praise be to God, who hath sent the Alcoran to his servant. There is no contradiction in this Book; it teacheth the right way; it preacheth to the wicked, that they shall suffer great torments, and proclaimeth to the righteous, that they shall enjoy an eternall felicity; it preacheth the torments of Hell, principally to such as affirm, That God hath a Son; they are ignorant, like to their predecessors; they are arrogant in their discourse, and utter nothing but blaspemies: Wilt thou destroy thy self in following their footsteps? If they believe not in the Alcoran, they shall one day have sorrow, and shall repent it. We adorned the Earth, with whatsoever is upon it, for the advantage of men. One part thereof is happy and plentifull; and the other unfruitfull, and desart. Do ye not believe that the sleepers that entred the Cave, and the Paper wherein their names were written, be our miracles? when those men entred the Cave, they said, Lord, give us thy mercy, and guide us into the right way: Then did we cause them to sleep for the space of some years, and awaked them, having continued some time in that Cave, to make it appear which of the two Religions was the most just. I will relate to thee their History with truth; they were young men, who had the fear of their Lord before their eyes;  we strengthned them, and encreased their faith; when they were with the Infidels, they said, Our God is Lord of Heaven and Earth, we will never worship but one God, otherwise we shall separate our selves from the truth: This people have adored Idols without reason; who is more unjust then he, who blasphemeth against God? When they deserted the Infidels, they worshipped one God alone. Enter into the Cave, God shall make his mercy towards you to appear, and shall guide you through a path, smooth and pleasant. When the Sun arose, he cast his rayes on the right side of their Cave, and on the left, at his going down; they in the mean time were in the most spacious place of this Cave. This is one of Gods miracles; hee whom he guideth, is well guided; and whom he misleadeth, shall find none to give him succour, or to guide him. Believe ye that they should be awake? Assuredly they slept and turned themselves, sometimes to one side, sometimes to another: Consider how their Dog extended his feet before that old habitation of stone; if any one had entred towards them, he would have caused them to flie, and had affrighted them. In the end we awaked them, and they mutually enquired of each other in what place they were, and how long they had there continued; one of them replyed, That they had been there a day or two; then they all said, God knoweth the time that we have abode here, send one of us to the City with money to buy bread and meat; let him not be fearfull, neither make himself known to any; if wee be known, they will murther, or constrain us to follow their Religion, in which we shall be eternally miserable. Thus did we stir up the people against them, to the end they might know that thy Lord is true; when he said, He will cause the dead to arise again, the Resurrection is indubitable; nevertheless unbelievers dispute among them, concerning the History of the Sleepers, and say, That they built a secret place to retire themselves, God knoweth the Truth. The True-believers believe that they made no building; the Infidels say they were five, and that their dog was the sixth, they speak by opinion; but the True-believers affirm them to be seven, and their  dog to be the eighth. Say unto them, My Lord knoweth how many they were; few persons except God, know ^heir number: Doubt no more the History of the Slee^ers, the matter is averred and known; dispute no more with the Jews, and say not, I will do this to morrow, without saying, If it please God. Call God to minde, after thou hast forgot him, and say, The Lord shall guide me, and teach me the History of the Sleepers,See Gelaldin. who remained in the Cave three hundred years; there be who affirme they continued there nine hundred years. Say unto them, God knoweth the time of their abode there, he knoweth whatsoever is in Heaven, and Earth, he understandeth and seeth all things, he alone disposeth every thing, and hath no companion; Preach what thy Lord hath inspired into thee, his word admitteth of no alteration, there is no safer refuge then in him; dwell with those that invoke him morning and evening, and desire to see his face; depart not from their company, if thou desirest to have content of life in this world; obey not those whose heart we have hardned, and are unmindfull of us; follow not their impiety, whatsoever they do, is but offence and sin. Say unto them, the truth proceedeth from your Lord; who shall desire [it] shall be True-believers, and who shall not desire [it] shall be an Infidell, we have prepared Hell to chastise the impious, and prisons wherein to detaine them. They shall implore succors against the melting pit, into which they shall be plunged, as into waters, it shall rost their faces, and shall be their drink; I will not frustrate of reward them that shall have done well, they shall enjoy the delights of the gardens of Eden, wherein flow many rivers, they shall have bracelets of ^ine Gold, they shall be cloathed with green, with Scarlet, and shining colours, and shall sit on thrones, with an eternall felicity. Declare to them this parable; there were two men, I gave to the one of them gardens, where^n was store of fruits, he in contempt told his companion, that he was more wealthy and powerfull then he, and entred into his gardens, being an Infidell, and an Idolater, and said, I doe not think these shall ever have an  end, they shall endure a long time without withering: His companion said to him; If thou dost not ackowledge this to proceed from God, and if thou be ingratefull towards him that created thee of dust, and made thee a man, thou shalt soon finde thy gardens ruined; this commeth from God my Lord, who hath no companion; all strength, and truth proceedeth from his divine Magesty; If I have lesse of substance then thou, God can give me fruits more faire then those of thy gardens, or send thunder that shall destroy them, he shall fill them with water of rain, that shall encompasse them, and hinder thee to approach [them.] In the morning this Infidell found his gardens destroyed to the very roots, he was extreamly perplexed, by reason of the expence he had made to plant them eavenly; and he said, would to God I had not adored Idols: He shall find none that is able to protect him at the day of Judgement, but God, all protection, and grace issueth from his divine bounty, and the end of the righteous shall be happy. Speak unto them this parable, the life of the world is like unto rain fallen from Heaven, that refreshed and revived the herbs of the Earth, and in the morning were drie as chaste, carried away by the winde; God is omnipotent: Riches and children are the ornaments of this life, but good works are eternall, they are acceptable to God, and give us hope of his grace. Be thou mindfull of the day when the mountains shall walk, and thou shalt see the Earth to be plain; that day we assemble the good and the wicked, and will not faile of my word to any person; that day shall the Infidels beseech the Lord to save them, he shall say unto them, you came unto us naked, as when we at first created you, and ye believed on Earth, that there was no resurrection; Then shall he give to every one the Book, wherein shall be written the accompt of their sinnes; Thou shalt see the wicked trembling with fear, saying, behold here our destruction! What is there in this Book? It containeth their veniall and mortall sinnes, and detecteth their offences, they shall find the number of their crimes before their eyes: Thy Lord is unjust to none;  Remember thou that we commanded the Angels to prostrate themselves before Adam, and that they humbled themselves, except the Devill, who was in the number of Angels, he disobeyed his Lord; neverthelesse Adam and his posterity have obeyed him, although he is their open enemy, and particularly of the Infidels. Consider ye not that God created Heaven and Earth, that he made you, and hath no need to be aided of you? Be thou mindfull of the day, when it shall be said to Idolaters, call upon your Idols that ye have worshipped, for remission of your sinnes; they shall implore them, but none shall hear their prayers, we have ruined them; the wicked shall behold the fire, into which they shall fall, and finde none to save them. We taught men in the Alcoran, many parables, yet do the wicked abound in questions and dispute too much; What hindreth men to believe, since there is come to them a guide, to conduct them into the right way? If they beg not pardon of God, what hapned to their predecessors, and at Beder, shall befall them, they shall be visibly punished; I send Prophets only to anounce the joyes of Paradise, and to preach the torments of Hell; the unbelievers dispute vainly, to obscure the truth, they deride my Commandements, and the fire of Hell; who is more unjust then hee who knoweth the Commandements of his Lord, and disobeyeth him, and forgetteth his past sinnes? We have hardned their hearts, they shall not understand the Scripture; we have stopped their eares, they shall heare nothing; if thou callest them to the right way, they shall not follow thee, thy Lord is gracious and mercifull; should he chastise them after their demerits, he should forthwith destroy them, he tarrieth untill the time that he hath promised to punish them, and they shall finde none of power to protect them. Wee have destroyed Cities, when their Inhabitants have offended, and we prefixed the day of their ruine. Remember thou that Moses said to his servant, I will travell incessantly, untill I see a place where two seas meet, although I travell an Age. When he came to that place, hee and his servant forgot their fish,  he had taken his way through the Sea: Having continued their voyage some time, Moses was an hungry, and demanded somewhat to eat of his servant, who said to him, Sawest thou what hapned at the Rock* I have forgotten our fish, the Devill made me to forget it, he miraculously took his way through the Sea; that Rock is the place which we seek: they both returned on their stops, discoursing together, untill they came to that Rock? where they found one of our servants, on whom we had conferred our graces, and inspired knowledge; Moses said unto him, permit me to follow thee, that thou maist teach me knowledge; and instruct me; He replyed, thou wilt not be able to abide patiently with me; how wilt thou patiently endure to hear a thing which none in the world eve^ knew? Moses said, thou shalt find me exceeding patient, and I will not disobey thee; He answered, if thou follow me, enquire nothing of me, and hear only what I shall say to thee. They went together, and they being in a boat, he brake a planck; Moses said to him, thou hast broken this vessell, to drown us, it is a strange thing; He answered, Did not I tell thee, that thou wilt not be able patiently to abide with me? Moses replied, excuse me, and afflict me not, I had forgotten what thou didst enjoyne me; They went on together untill they met with a child, whom he slew; Moses said to him, thou hast slain an innocent, that hath not slain any one; thou hast done a thing without reason, and that ought not to be approved: He answered, did I not say, thou wilt not be able patiently to abide with me? Moses said to him, excuse me this time also, if I demand ought else of thee, abandon me. They coninued their way unto a Village, where the Inhabitants refused them bread; at that time they found a wall ruined, which he raised again; Moses said unto him, thou shouldst have been payed for repairing this wall, if thou wouldest: He answered, now behold the place of our separation, nevertheless I will explain to thee what thou we^t impatient to learn. That boat belongeth to two poor men, who labour on the sea to gain their subsistance, I would have pierced it, to preserve it to those poor men,  because there was an Infidell Prince, who by force seized on the good vessels for his service. That infant which I flew was an Idolater, the son of a true believer, a righteous man; we feared he might cause his father to sin, and seduce him into his error, and infidelity; the Lord through his goodness would have him to be destroyed, to deliver his father from his malice. The wall appertaineth to two infant Orphans of this City, there is under it a treasure that belongeth to them, their father was a righteous man, God through his goodness willeth: that the treasure be preserved for them, untill they attain to years of discretion; he likewise willed me to do what I have done: behold the exposition of what thou wert impatient to learn. If any one enquire of thee concerning Alexander the great, relate to them his History: we gave him on earth what he desired, he went as far as the West, where he found a fountain guarded by a man, who said to him, O Alexander! chastise men through the murther of their persons, bondage, and ransome; he answered, I will put to death unbelievers in this world, and the Lord shall punish them in hell, and the righteous shall enjoy the glory of Paradise; I will tell the wicked, that God hath given us what we have desired. After this, he continued his way untill he came to a place, where the Sun riseth; he found that it riseth in a countrey, where they have nothing to shelter them from its heat, the thing is so: we taught Alexander how to shelter himself; he followed his way, untill he arrived between two mountains, inhabited of a Nation that spake a Language, which he could hardly understand; they said to him, O Alexander! Jagog, and Magog defile the earth, canst thou put between them and us an obstacle, to hinder that they may not come to us? God, said Alexander, hath not given me means to do it; but assist me with your power, I will put between them and you a strong separation; give me iron that can cut stones, that I may build betwixt the two mountains, and that I may fortifie the way that devideth them; blow when the iron striketh the stones, to ^indle fire, and poure on m^lten brass to joyn the stones and  iron together; if they come, they cannot pierce through the mountains, neither find a way to come to you, this is a favour which God conferreth on you, his promises are infallible; when the hour arriveth, he is true in what hee promiseth; we will permit them to mixe each with other; we will assemble all of them when the Trumpet shall sound; then will we open Hell to the wicked, and to such as would neither see, nor hear the Alcoran; Do they imagine them that worship me to be their gods? we have prepared hell to punish them. Say unto them, shall I relate unto thee what shall befall the damned, their works shall be unprofitable in this world, although they think to do well; good works are unprofitable to them that contemn the Commandements of their Lord, and believe not in the Resurrection, they shall not want ballance at the day of Judgement; hell shall be their habitation, because they deride our Commandements, and our Apostles, and Prophets; The righteous shall enjoy eternally the delight of Paradise without discontinuation. If the sea were inke, to write the wondrous works of my Lord, it will sooner have an end, then his miracles: Say unto the Infidels, I am a man like you, God hath taught me that there is but one God; he that believeth in the Resurrection, studieth to do good works; worship but one God, who is without a companion.   CHAP. XIX. The Chapter of Mary, containing fourscore and eighteen Verses, written at Mecca. IN the Name of God, gracious and merciful: God is the rewarder, conductor, (of the righteous) liberall, wise, true: Zachery, the servant of thy Lord remembred his grace, when he in secret prayed to his Lord, and said, Lord, my bones are become feeble, and mine head is white with old age; Lord, I was never rejected in my prayers, hear my petition, give me a son to succeed me, that may be mine heir, heir of the lineage of Jacob, and  be pleasing to thee. O Zachary! I declare unto thee, that thou shalt have a son, named John, no man hath yet been called by that name; he said, Lord, how shall I have a son, my wife is barren, and I am too old? It was answered him, the thing shall be as I have said unto thee, it is easie to thy Lord; who created thee; he said, Lord give me some signe of the conception of my wife; he said to him, thou shalt not speak for three nights. Then went he out of his Oratory, and made signes to the people, to make their prayers evening and morning. Oh John!See Kitab el tenoir. learn the Scripture with affection; We from his infancie gave him knowledge, clemency, charity, piety, affection towards his father and mother, and not violence and disobedience. We blessed the day of his nativity, the day that he shall dye, and the day that he shall rise again. Remember thou what is written of Mary, she retired towards the East, into a place farre remote from her kindred, and took a vaile to cover her, we sent her our Spirit in forme of a man; she was afraid, and said, God will preserve me from thee, if thou have his fear before thine eyes; hee said, oh Mary! I am the Messenger of God thy Lord, who shall give thee a Sonne, active, and prudent: She answered, how shall I have a sonne without the touch of man? I desire not to be unchaste; he said, The thing shall be as I have told thee, it is facile to thy Lord; thy sonne shall be a token of the omnipotency of God, and of his speciall grace towards such as shall believe in his divine Majesty; She became with child, and retired some time, into a place remote from people, where she sustained the colours of Child-birth, at the foot of a Date-tree, and said, why am I not dead? wherefore am I not in the number of persons forgotten? The Angell said to her, afflict not thy selfe; God hath placed a brook under thee, shake the foot of this Palme, and the Dates shall fall, gather them up, eat and drink, and wash thine eyes, say unto them that thou shalt meet, that thou fastest, and hast made a vow not to speak to any one, untill thy fast be accomplished. Her parents met her while she bare her Infant,  and said unto her, oh Mary! behold a strange thing; oh sister of A^ron! thy father did not command thee to doe evill, neither was thy mother unchaste; She made signes to her infant to answer them; they said, how shall the infant in the Cradle speak? Then her infant spake, and said, I am the servant of God, hee hath taught me the Scripture, hath made me a Prophet, blessed me in all places, and commanded me to pray unto him; hoe hath recommended to me purity through the whole course of my life, and to honour my father and mother; hee hath not made me either violent or malicious, praysed shall be the day of my birth, the day that I shall dye, and the day of my resurrection. Thus spake Jesus, the sonne of M^^y, with truth, of which ye doubt: God approveth not the discourse of them that say he hath a sonne; praised be God, when he willeth any thing, he saith, be thou, and it is; he is mine and your Lord, worship him, this is the right way; there be persons, who in this regard have been of different opinion, but misery is upon the incrudulous, they shall be miserable at the day of Judgement. The Infidels are manifestly erroneous from the right way; If thou preach to them the torments of Hell and their ignorance, they will not hear thee. Wee are Lords of whatsoever is on Earth, and dispose of every thing at our pleasure, they shall be one day assembled before us to be judged. Remember thou what is written of Abraham, he was a righteous man, and a Prophet, he said to his Father, adore not what neither seeth; nor understandeth any thing, and that cannot be profitable; I know what ye know not, follow me, and I will conduct you into the right way; worship not the Devill, he is disobedient unto God; otherwise I fear that God may chastise you, and you may be in the number of the damned. He answered, oh Abraham! dost thou abhorre my Gods? unlesse thou change thy discourse, I will stone thee, depart from me for a long time; he said, May God inspire you, I will pray for you, he is exceeding good, and will hear my prayers; Whom will ye adore, when I shall be gone from  you? Worship God my Lord, and your prayers shall be heard; he departed from them, and worshipped one God: We gave him two sonnes, Iasaac, and Jacob, both Prophets, we conferred our grace upon him, with an eloquent and true tongue. Remember thou what is written of Moses he was a righteous man, our Prophet and Messenger; we called him on the right side of the Mount Sinai, drew him neer unto us, and taught him our secrets; We through speciall g^^^ gave him a brother, named Aaron Remember thou what is written of Ismael, he exactly observed what he promised, was a Prophet, and an Apostle of the Lord, preached purity, and recommended to men to make their prayers often, and was pleasing to his Lord. Remember thou what is written of Enoch, hee was a just man, and a Prophet, and we took him up to an exceeding high place. God gave his grace to these men, among the Prophets of the lineage of Adam, among them whom we caused to embarke with Noah, among those of the lineage of Abraham, and Israel, and among those that we assembled and guided into the right way. When the miracles of the mercifull were related to them, they fell prostrate, and adored him with tears in their eyes; their posterity forsook their footsteps, abandoned the Law, and followed their own appetites; but they shall be precipitated into Hell, except such as shall be converted, and do good works, they shall enter into Paradise, and no injustice shall be done to them, they shall enter into the garden of Eden; what the mercifull [God] doth promise, is infallible; they shall hear nothing spoken in Paradise that shall displease them, they shall hear the salutation of Angels, and morning and evening shall have what they desire; such is Paradise, which God giveth to his creatures that have his fear before their eyes. I Gelaldin saith, ^ that Mahomet complaineth to the Angel Gabriel for having been so long absent from him. descend not from Heaven* but by the permission of the Lord, he is master of our actions in Heaven and Earth, and of whatsoever is between them, he hath not forgot thee, worship him, and persevere in thy adoration, knowest thou any person that is named, like him? Man saith, what,  shall I dye and rise again? He considereth not that God hath created him of nothing; I will one day assemble the Infidels, and Devils, I will cause them to appear at the gate of Hell upon their knees, and will cast upon them all manner of misery, because they have encreased their impiety towards their Lord. I know such as deserve to burn in Hell, they shall be thrown thither headlong, this is a most just sentence pronounced by the Lord. I will save the righteous, and forbid^^^ fidels to fall on their knees before Idols: when the unbelievers, and many of the faithfull heard my Commandements preached, they said among themselves, that they were in a better way then their neighbour; how many have we destroyed befor them, in past Ages, more rich then they, and hypocrites like unto them? Say unto them, God prolongeth the l^fe of the erroneous, that they may know their errors, and learn the knowledge of the pains prepared for them, they shall understand who shall be the most miserable; and who shall have been most weak in their faith, and least affectionate to the service of his divine Majesty; God shall encrease their faith, who shall follow the right way; and such as be obedient to him, shall enjoy his grace. Hast thou considered the action of the wicked? They demand, if they shall have riches and children after their Resurrection? Would you know what shall be? would you capitulate with the mercifull? I will not do it; I will write all that they say, and will adde to their miseries; I will give to them in this world, what they require, and they shall rise again naked (without treasure, and children.See Gelaldin.) They adored Idols, to have their protection. Certainly they erred in that adoration; they shall renounce them, and be their enemies at the day of Judgement. Seest thou not, how we have sent the Devils against unbeliev^rs, to seduce them? Be not impatient to to see them punished, they shall be judged at the day appointed. Be thou mindfull of the day, when I shall assemble all the righteous in the presence of God, and pr^cipitate all the wicked into Hell; their prayers shall not be  heard, except such as have accomplished their promises to the mercifull. They have said, Do ye believe that God hath a Son? You utter a strange thing; it wanteth not much, but that Heaven and Earth open themselves, and that the Mountains fall, with their utter destruction. They call God, God the Son; God hath not to do with a Son; whatsoever is in Heaven and Earth, adore him; he knoweth the accompt and number of all things of the world: Men shall appear before him at the day of Judgement, and the True-believers that shall do good works, shall be beloved of his divine Majesty. We have sent thee the Alcoran, written in thine own Language, that thou mayst proclaim the delights of Paradise, to them that fear me, and preach the torments of Hell to such as dispute with obstinacy against the Faith. How many of the wicked have we destroyed in past ages? Hast thou heard speak of them? Hast thou heard mention of their memory?   CHAP. XX. The Chapter of Beatitude, and of Hell, containing on hundred and thi^ty Verses, written at Mecca.  Reader, the Mahometans have entituled this Chapter Tthe, which is two letters of the Arabique Alphabet, ^o wit, Tt and He; where in this place, Tt signifieth* Thouba, ^hat is to say, Beatitude; and H^ Hao^h, that is to say, Hell. See the gloss, and interpretation of Gelaldin, and Bedao^; they have intituled this Chapter of Beatitude, and of Hell.  IN the name of God gracious and mercifull. We have not given thee the Alcoran to torment thee, but to instruct therein the righteous. It was sent thee by him, that created the Heavens and the Earth; the mercifull sitteth on his Throne; whatsoever is in Heaven^ and Earth, whatsoever is between them, and beneath the Earth, appertaineth to him. He knoweth thy thoughts, he  understandeth what thou keepest secret, and what thou makest manifest. God! there is but one God, all the glorious names of the world are due unto him. Knowest thou the History of Moses? When he beheld the fire, he said to his family, Stay ye here, I see a great fire, I will bring to you a spark, and you shall find in it the right way. When he approached, it was said unto him, O Moses! I am thy Lord, put off thy shooes, thou art in the holy Valley of Toy, I have elected thee among my people, hear my word, and receive mine inspirations; I am God, there is none other God but I, worship me alone, and make thy prayers as it is ordained; The hour unknown to the world approacheth, wherein I will recompence and chastise every one after his works: Take heed lest the wicked seduce thee from the right way; if thou follow their appetite, thou shalt be destroyed; Is it not what thou hast sworn to me? he answered, Lord, I will apply my selfe unto thee, and will lean upon my staffe; I will beat the fruits of the Trees to make them fall upon my flocks; I have yet another manner to nourish my sheep with this staff; I will make use of it to defend, and preserve them from mischief; God said unto him, O Moses! cast that staffe to the ground, behold a Serpent, it creepeth, take it, and be not afraid, I will cause it to return to its former condition; draw back thine hand, and put it under thy arm it shall become white and shining, without harm, and pain, it shall be a most certain sign of my Unity, I will give thee to see the miracles of my Omnipotencie; go to Pharoah, he is in an exceeding great error, and seduced from the right way: Moses said, Lord, rejoyce my heart, and facilitate my commission, unloose the knot of my tongue, that they may understand my speech: give me Aaron to assist me in this business, that I may praise thee, and highly exalt thy glory, thou only art our protector. God said, thy prayer is heard, we were favourable to thee another time, when we inspired thy mother to put thee into a coffer, and expose thee to the river of Nile; the water drove thee to the shore, whence Pharoah took thee;  I caused thee to be beloved of him, to have care of my people; when thy sister sought t^dings of what was become of thee, she said, who will guide us where he is? who will conduct us to him that keepeth him? we sent thee back to thy mother, to stop her tears, and put an end to her affection. Thou slewest a man, we have delivered thee from the hands of thine enemies, and have approved thy perseverance; thou hast continued some time with the inhabitants of Madian; after this we sent thee to preach our Commandements; I have made choise of thee, goe with thy brother to Pharoah, and lie not in speaking of me, he is gone astray from the right way; speak to him both of you, with mildnesse, peradventure he will hearken to you, and will fear the fire of hell; they answered, Lord, wee fear that he may torment, and rise up against us; he said, fear nothing, I will be with you, hear what he will say, consider his actions; address your selves to him, and say, we are the Messengers of the Omnipotent God; dismiss with us the children of Israel, and no more torment them, we are come hither by the Commandement of God, thy Lord. Salvation is for such as follow the right way; damnation for them that blaspheme against his Law, and depart from his Commandements; Pharoah said unto them, who is your God? Moses said, my God is he that created the world, and guideth men into the right way. Pharoah said, what law did your predecessors observe? what is become of them? Moses answered, God knoweth in what condition they are; nothing is concealed from God, he extended the earth, and established the wayes; he causeth rain to descend from heaven, and maketh to spring forth the plants, herbs, and fruits which ye eat, and that nourish your flocks. These things are signs of his Omnipotency to them that understand them. We created you of earth, and to earth will we make you to return, and will cause you to come out of it once again; we shewed miracles to Pharoah, but he was incredulous, contemned them, and said, O Moses! Are thou come to drive us out of our Dominions with thy Magick? I will shew thee [Magick] like to thine; let us  meet at a place, and day prefixed between the and me, to come together; Moses said unto him, let us make choise of the day of your feast; if it seem good to you, the people may assemble at the Sun rising: After this discourse, Pharoah withdrew, recollected all his subtilties, and at the day and hour prefixed, came with his people to the place appointed, where Moses was, who said unto them, misery is upon you, blaspheme not against God, he will punish you, and destroy them that blaspheme against him; The people of Pharaoh differed in opinion what they should do, kept their designe secret, and said to Pharoah, these two men are Magicians, they would chase you from your Countrey, through their Magick, and seduce your subjects from your Religion; recollect your subtilties and power, and chuse persons capable to dispute against them, this day shall be happy to him that shall be victorious. They said to Moses, wilt thou first cast thy staffe on the ground, or shall we ours? Their cords and staves arose against Moses through their Magick, and crawled: Moses spake low, between his teeth; we said unto him, fear nothing, thou shalt be victorious, cast thy staffe in thy right hand on the ground, it shall devoure what they have done, it is but witchcraft and magick that produceth neither Profit nor Content. Then fell the Magicians of Pharoah prostrate on the ground, and said, We believe in the God of Aaron and Moses; Pharoah said unto them, believe ye in him without my permission? Moses is your master, I will cut off your right feet, and your left hands; or your left feet, and your right hands, and cause you to be hanged on Palme trees, that ye may know who is the more severe in his chastisements, I, or the God of Moses; They said, the miracles that thou hast seen, have they not touched thee? He that created us, doth things which are not in thy power to performe; thy power extendeth only in this world, we believe in God our Lord, who will pardon our sinnes; thou art the cause that hee abhorreth us with our magick, hee is more powerfull then thou, and eternall; Hell is prepared for Infidels,  they shall finde repose neither in their life nor death, and the righteous that shall do good works, shall eternally enjoy the pleasures of the gardens of Eden, wherein slow many delicious rivers, such is the reward of them that are purged from their sins. We said unto Moses, go out by night with my people, and make them a drie path through the Sea, fear not that thine enemies may overtake thee, neither be afraid of being drowned, Paraoh shall follow them with his troops; I will overwhelm in the sea, and will mislead him with his people, he shall not follow the right way. O children of Israel! we delivered you from your enemies, and conducted you towards the mountains of Sinai: we caused Manna and Quailes to descend upon you, and said, eat ye of the good things that we have given you, and be not ungratefull, otherwise my wrath shall fall upon you; he upon whom mine indignation shall fall, shall be thrown headlong into the fire of hell; I will be mercifull to such as shall convert, do good works, and follow the right way. O Moses! who pressed thee to absent thy self from thy people? He answered, behold he that followeth my steps, I am come up to receive thy Commandements. We after thy departure estranged thy people from thee, and Samery seduced them from the right way; he returned upon his steps to his people, in great displeasure, and said, O ye people! did not God promise to you all manner of content? he protracted the effect of his promises, because of your sins, will you that his wrath fall upon you? wherefore have ye transgressed what ye promised to me? They said, we have not transgressed our promises of our own accord; we took the most weighty ornaments of the people, and cast them into the fire, Samery himself did cast them in; he made the body of a bellowing Calfe, and said, with his followers, behold there your God, the God of Moses whom he hath forgotten; Saw they not that this Calf spake not to them, and that it had not power to do good or evill? Aaron had said unto them, before the comming of Moses; O ye people! you have been seduced by this Calfe;  the mercifull is your God, and your Lord, follow and obey me: They said, shall we abide here untill Moses returne? Moses at his return said unto Aaron what hindred thee to follow me, when thou sawest them to turne aside from the Law of God? wherefore hast thou disobeyed me? O son of my mother! (said Aaron) drag me not by the beard, and haire, I feared to displease thee, if I forsook the children of Israel, and disobey thy Commandements; Moses said unto Samery, what was thy design? he answered, I saw what this people seeth not, I took an handfull of the earth of the footsteps of the Messenger of God, and made the Figure of a Calfe, the fairest that I could; Moses said unto him, goe, get thee from among us, thou shalt fly the presence of men all the dayes of thy life; thou shalt say unto them, come not nigh me, touch me not, the time of thy punishment is appointed, thou shalt not escape it, behold thy false god, behold the Calfe which thou hast adored, I will cause it to burne, and will cast the ashes thereof into the sea; your God is one God, and there is none other God, but the God that knoweth all things: Thus doe I relate to thee things past; we have sent thee the Alcoran, such as shall abjure it, shall beare their burthen at the day of Judgement, and be eternally tormented; I will one day require an account of their burden, and will assemble them with all their subtilities; when the Trumpet shall sound, they shall demand of each other, how long they have continued in the world? they shall say, that they have remained there but ten dayes and ten nights, I know all that they will say; the most prudent among them shall say, that they have been but one day. They shall enquire of thee concerning the Mountains; Say unto them, God shall teare them up, and levell them with the Earth, thou shalt see them levelled and beaten downe: then shall men without retardment follow him that shall summon them to universall Judgement, they shall humble themselves before God, thou shalt that day heare low and humble voyces, that day shall prayers be ineffectuall, except of them that shall be  pleasing to God, whom he will permit to speak. He knoweth whatsoever men doe in this world, and what must befall them in the other, and they know it not, they shall humble themselves, and hang down the head before the living and eternall Lord, all Infidels shall be damned, and the righteous of True-believers that have done good works, shall not feare injustice. We have sent the Alcoran in the Arabique tongue, it teacheth men our Commandements, peradventure they will feare impiety; it teacheth them what they ought to know; Exalt the glory of God, King of the world, he is truth it selfe; presse not thy selfe to read the Alcoran, untill thou hast well understood it. Say, Lord encrease my knowledge; We heretofore prohibited Adam to eat of the forbidden fruit, he was unmindfull of our Commandement, I found in him no perseverance. Remember thou that we commanded the Angels to humble themselves before him, they humbled themselves, except the Devill, who refused to doe it. Remember that we said, Adam, the Devill is thine enemy, and the enemy of thy wife, he will endeavour to make you miserable, to cause you both to goe out of Paradise, where thou sufferest neither hunger nor thirst, nor cold, nor heat; The Devill tempted them, and said, oh Adam! I will conduct thee to the tree of eternity, a treasure that shall never perish, they did both eat of the fruit of that tree, then knew they their filthinesse, and took the leaves of trees to cover their nakednesse; Adam disobeyed his Lord, and became miserable, neverthelesse he heard, and pardoned him, and shewed him the right way; he said, discend from Paradise, ye enemies of each other, I will hereafter send you a guide, he that shall follow him, shall not erre, and shall be blessed; He that shall goe astray, and will not believe in me, shall be miserable in the world, and blind at the day of Judgement; that day shall he say, Lord, wherefore hast thou made me blind* I had good sight when I was in the world: I did this day forget thee, as thou didst forget my Commandements: thus doe I intreat Infidels. The torments  of the other world are more grievous then those of the Earth, and of longer continuance; doe not unbelievers tremble, when they consider how many men upon Earth we have destroyed in past Ages? Their misery shall serve for example to them that are wise; Had not thy Lord said, that he will deferre the punishment of the wicked untill the time appointed, he had already destroyed them. Be patient, and endure their discourse, praise thy Lord before the Sunne arise, before it setteth, an hour before night, and at the end of day thou shalt doe a thing acceptable to him: The life of the world is sweet to tempt you, but the riches of thy Lord are better, and eternall. Command the people to make their prayers at the time appointed, and be not impatient towards them, I require no riches of thee, I will enrich thee, and in the end Paradise shall be for the righteous. The unbelievers have said, if Mahomet sheweth not some racle from God, and knoweth not the exposition of the books of our predecessors, we will not believe in him; We before his comming destroyed many wicked persons, who said, Lord, hadst thou sent us a Prophet, we had observed thy Commandements, before we became infamous, and laden with ignominie; Say unto them, every one expecteth his end, expect ye, and ye shall one day know them that follow the right way, and have not erred.   CHAP. XXI. The Chapter of the Prophets, containing an hundred and twelve Verses, written at Mecca. IN the Name of God, gracious and mercifull. The day approacheth, wherein the people shall render an accompt of their actions, but they consider it not, and depart from the Commandements of God; if they heare them, they laugh, they understand them not, and keep secret their evill intention. Is not Mahomet a man like to you? Will ye  say that he is a Magician? you see the contrary; God heareth whatsoever is spoken, both in Heaven and Earth, and knoweth all things. They say, certainly Mahomet hath dreamed what he speaketh, he hath invented it, and is a Poet, we will not believe him, unless he shew some miracle, as did the Prophets that were before him. We have layed waste many Cities, because their inhabitants were incredulous; we sent before thee but men who were inspired of us; Enquire of them, to whom heretofore was given the knowledge of the written Law, if ye know it not; they were men that did eat and drink, and were mortal^; we effected what we promised to them, we preserved them with such as believed, and destroyed the incredulous; We have sent you a Book to instruct you, will ye understand it? How many Infidel Cities have wee made desolate? How many new people have we established in their place? When they felt our punishment, they fled; fly not, and return to what hath delighted you, return into your houses, peradventure ye will yet cover the riches of the Earth; They said, misery is upon us, we are too blame; Thus did they talke, untill they were destroyed. We have not created Heaven and Earth, and whatsoever is between them, to sport with; had it been our will that they should have scoffed on Earth, they should scoffe likewise in Heaven. On the contrary, I oppose the truth to falsehood, to confound it, and in effect it doth confound it. Misery shall be upon you, because of your blasphemies; whatsoever is in Heaven and Earth, is Gods; the Angels are not ashamed to worship him, they prayse him day and night, and exalt his glory without blasphemie. The Infidels worship Gods made of Earth; Have they power to create any thing? Were there in Heaven, and on Earth another God, they would not accord; praised be God, Lord of the Universe; what the Infidels relate, is untrue. Hee asketh no counsell when he will doe any thing, as do men; will they worship any other God but him? Say unto them, produce your arguments, behold what we have to speak  unto you, behold our reasons, and those of our predecessors; Certainly, the greatest part of them are ignorant of the truth, and goe astray. We inspired into all the Prophets which we sent, that there was but one God that ought to be worshipped. They said, believe ye that the Angels are the sonnes of God? Praysed be God; on the contrary, they are his creatures, he loveth them, they speak not but after him, and obey what he commandeth them, he knoweth all their actions past, and future, they pray for no man but through his permission, and feare to displease him. Who among them will say I am God, instead of God? he shall be cast headlong into the fire of Hell; thus doe I intreat unbelievers. Know they not that the Heavens and the Earth were shut up? We opened them, and gave life to every thing, through the raine which we made to descend; will they not believe in my unity? We created the Mountains to hinder the Earth to move, we made therein wayes large and spacious for our Creatures, we covered it with the Heaven, and have exempted it from falling, neverthelesse they despise our Commandement. It is the Lord who created day and night, the Moone and the Sunne, all things praise and exalt him in Heaven; we created no person to dwell for over on Earth; all men shall taste of death, I will prove you with good and evill, and ye shall appeare before me to give accompt of your actions: The Infidels scoffe at you, when they see you, and say, behold them that deride our Gods! They obey not the Commandements of God; he created man of dust, and shall shew you the effects of his omnipotency, be not impatient to see the punishment of the wicked, who say, when shall be the day of judgement? did they know it, they would remove the fire from their backs and visages; that day shall surprize them, it shall astonish them when they thinke least of it, they cannot retard it, and shall be deprived of protection. Certainly they scorned the Prophets that were sent before thee, but they were punished after their demerits. Say unto them,  who but the mercifull [God] preserveth you day and night? neverthelesse yee reject his Commandements; Have they any other God but me, that is able to save them? Their Gods cannot defend themselves: I will not protect them, yet will I enrich them, as I enriched their fathers, and will prolong their life, to punish them on Earth; Know they not that their estates diminish on all sides through thy Conquests? Is it so, that they are victorious? Say unto them, I preach to you what God hath inspired into me, but the deafe heare not when they are exhorted; When they are a little touched with the chastisements of God, they say, oh misery! We are too blame, and are unjust; I will weigh their workes at the day of Judgement, that I may doe injustice to no person, of the weight of a grain of mustard-seed, and will most exactly accompt. We gave to Moses and Aaron the Book that distinguisheth good from evill, and commanded them to preach our Commandements to them that had our feare before their eyes. That Booke is blessed, and was sent from us; neverthelesse unbelievers reject and condemne it. We heretofore instructed Abraham in the right way, and knew that he was a righteous man. Remember thou that he said to his father, and his people, what Idols doe ye adore? They said, wee find that our Fathers adore^ them; he said unto them, your fathers and you were exceedingly erroneous: they said, dost thou speak the truth, or dost thou jeast? He said, Certainely your Lord is the Lord of Heaven and Earth, I sweare to you that he created them; Having convinced those Idola^er^, he said, by God, I will make Warne upon your Idol^, he broke them with an hatchet in their absence, except the gr^atest Idoll, on which he hung his hatchet, and said, peradventure they will accuse him to have broken the other: Seeing at their returne their Idols broken, they said, who hath in this mannner handled our Gods? He is impious; we heard it is a young man, named Abraham, who derideth them, bring  him before the eyes of the people, perhaps they shall find witnesses of his Action. They said unto him, oh Abraham! it is thou that hast so abused our Gods, he said on the contrary, it is that great Idol; They enquired of each other if those Idols spake, and if they had motion; afterwards they returned to themselves, and said to the people, ye are too blame to adore those Idols; he threw them headlong against the ground, and they said, oh Abram! thou well knewest that they spake not at all; he answered, why therefore doe ye worship what can neither benefit nor hurt you? You defile your selves in adoring them instead of God, doe ye not know him? Then they said, burne Abraham, and let us defend our Gods, if ye are righteous men: but we commanded the fire to lose its heat, to preserve Abraham; They would have tormented him, and we destroyed them, we saved him, as we preserved Lot, we conducted him into the Land of blessing, gave him Isaac, and Jacob, and the Children of their Children, righteous men, and True-believers, to instruct the people in the way of Salvation; wee inspired them to doe good workes, to pray at the time appointed, to pay Tithes, and to worship us; Wee gave to Lot prudence and knowledge, and delivered him from the Inhabitants of the City, who were the most vicious upon Earth, we were gracious to him, because he was righteous. Remember Noah, and that hee heretofore invoked us; wee heard his prayer, and delivered him from great danger, and all that were with him in the Arke; we delivered him from the hand of the wicked, whom wee drowned. Remember David and Salomon, who rendred Justice in the field, whereinto the flocks of the village entred by night without Shepheards; wee are witnesse of their Judgements, wee instructed Salomon in Justice, we gave his prudence and knowledge; the Mountaines adored us with David, and with him  the Birds praised us; we were with them when they praised us. We taught you the manner of sowing [seed] to preserve you from necessity; peradventure ye will be thankfull to me. We commanded the winds to obey Solomon, and know all that he did. The devils obeyed him, they dived into the sea, to fis^i for Gems for him, and travelled also in other matters; and we hindered them to act mischief against men. Remember Job, who prayed to his Lord and said, I am in exceeding great affliction; thou art the merciful of the merciful: we heard him, and delivered him from his affliction; gave to him our grace, and to his family, and to them that were with him, who had patience, and trusted in me. Remember Ismael, Enoch,Delcafel is Ely. Delcafel and Zachary, they persevered in wel doing; we gave them our grace because they were righteous. Remember Jonas,See the book composed by Abdel^a^y who forsooke his people in displeasure; he beleived I could doe nothing against him; but he cryed in the dark, and said, There is no God besides thee, praised be thy name; I am too blame for having offended thee: We heard him, and delivered him from his disaster. Thus do I protect true-beleivers, when they invoke me. Remember Zachary, who made his prayer^ and said, Lord, I know there is no better heir in the world then thy self; yet let me not dy without issue: We heard his request, gave him a son, named Jon, and rendred his wife fruitfull. All these Prophets went on with alacrity to do well, and invoked us with humility, with desire to obtain our grace, and with fear of the torments of hel. Remember Mary, whose womb I blessed; we inspired into her our Spirit, and gave her a Son, a miracle in the world. Your law is on onely law, and I am one only God, worship me, and be not impious; ye all shal appear before me to be judged, I will protect the true believers that shall have done good works, and wil write what they shall do for their reward. M^sery is upon the Cities that we have ruined; their inhabitants shall not return into the world, untill the passage be opened to Jagog and Magog, and they come running from the eminent places of the earth; then shall the day of Iudgment approach; the promised Truth shall not be far off, it shall trouble the sight of the wicked. Who shall say  O misery! We are miserable, we did not foresee this disaster; we have been excedingly too blame for having offended God. It shall be said unto them, ye worshipped instead of God, the firebrands of Hell, into which ye shall be cast headlong: Had your Idols been Gods, as ye beleived, they should not have entred Hell; they, and those that have adored them, shal be eternally damned; they shall groan, complain, and shal not be heard: Such as shall be in paradise, shall be far remote from them: they shall not hear their howlings, and shall enjoy eternally what they shall desire, the cryes of the damned shall not afflict them; the Angels shall meet them when they come out of their graves, and shall say, Behold now the day that was foretold you in the world; a day, wherein wee will open the heavens, and the book of the accompt of all men, as we promised to your predecessors. We exactly perform what we promise; we have written in the Old Testament, and afterwards in the Alcoran, That the righteous shall inherit the Earth: This Book shall teach the way to Paradise to them that shall worship mee: We had not sent thee, but in favour of men; say unto them God hath alwayes inspired into me, that your God is one God, will ye not obey him? If they go astray, I have taught you how they must be intreated. Say unto them, I know not whether the punishment denounced to you shall be speedy, or tardy. God knoweth what is known, and unknowne in the world, I know not whether he will try you, or defer his punishment untill the time appointed: He is a most just judg, and most mercifull, he is not such as ye speak him.    CHAP. XXII. The Chapter of Pilgrimage, containing seventy and seven Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. O ye people! fear God. The Earthquake that shall happen at the day of Judgment shall be wonderfull; ye shall that day see mothers forget their children, and every one shall bear his own burden; ye shall see men drunk, not with Wine, but amazed and astonished at the great j^dgments of God. There be, who dispute of the Deity with ignorance, and follow the will of the Devill, voluntary and obstinate: It is written, he shall seduce them that obey him, and shall conduct them into Hell. O ye people! if ye doubt of the Resurrection, consider how we created you of the dust of the Earth; with a little water sprinkled upon the dust, with congeaied blood, and a little flesh intirely, and not intirely formed. I form in the Wombs of Women, what seemeth good to me, at the time appointed. I cause you to come forth children, then I give you life, and make you to arrive to the age of virility; some die young, and others live to extremity of age, to the end they may learn to live well. Consider the Earth, dry, dead, and barren; when we shall cause rain to fall, it shall change the face, shall produce and nourish its fruits of all sorts, ^air, and pleasing. Because God is truth it selfe, he raiseth again the deed, and is Omnipotent. There is no doubt but the day of Iudgement approacheth, and that God will cause the dead to rise again. There be men that dispute of God without knowledge, without reason, without authority, and go astray from the way of his Law; they shall be ful of ignominy and shame in this world, and shall feel in the other, the pains of Hel. God doth no injustice to his people. There be who adore him with scruple; if good befall them, they persevere to adore him; if evill, they returne to their impiety, and l^se the riches of Earth, and the riches of Heaven: These tw^ losses are exce^ding great  they invok Idols instead of God; they invoke what can neither benefit, nor hurt them; Such prayers are by-ways, far remote from the Commandements of God; they worshi^ that which doth rather mischief, nor advantage them. Certainly, God shall make the True-believers, that do good works, to ^nter into Gardens, wherein flow many Rivers; he doth w^at seemeth good to him. He that is angry, that God giveth succour, and protection to Mahomet in this world,See KITA. BEL tenior. and in the other, let him tye a cord to a beam of his house, and hang himselfe; he shall see if his choller will be allayed. God hath sent the Alcoran, as heretofore he sent the other Scriptures; it containeth his Commandements, clear and intel^igible; it guideth into the right way whom it pleaseth him: He at the day of Judgement shall judge the differences that are betweene the faithful, and Infidels; between the Samaritans, the Christians, and Idolaters; he is omniscient. Seest thou not that all that is in Heaven, and on Earth, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the Mountains, Trees, and Beasts, adore him? Many worship him with zeal, but many likewise merit to be punished: None shall esteem him, whom God shall despise, he doth as seemeth good to him. These two contrary parti^^ the Believers and the Infidels, have disputed of the Deity; but the Infidels shall be encompassed with flames of Hell, they shall have shirts of fire, boyling water shall flow in upon their heads; the fire shall burn what is in their bellies, and shall roast their skin, they shall be beaten with clubs of Iron; when they think to go out of this fire, they shall enter further into it, and be eternally tormented. God shal cause the True-believers, that have don good wo^ks, to go into Gardens, wherein flow many Rivers; they shall be adorned with bracelets of Gold, and Pearls; they shall be clothed with Silk, and enjoy eternall felic^ty, because they have professed his Unity; and the Infidels shall suffer great torments, for that they have hindred the people to imbrace t^e Faith, and visit the Temple of Mecca, which God hath establis^ed to be therein adored of all the world: He that sha^l be solicited to visit it, and shall enter it, with ^^^^gn to return to his impiety, shall be severely punished.  Remember, that we shewed to Abraham the place to build the Temple of Mecca; that we commanded him to adore me alone, and to purge my Temple from Idols, for the satisfaction of them that should there make processions. Men shall come thither to visit thee from all parts, on foot, and on horse-back; they shall receive profit, they shall there make there prayers at the times appointed, and the days nominated; they shall thank the Lord for his benefits towards them, and the riches which he hath giv^n them; and shall make likewise processions at the old Temple. He that shall reverence it, shall do exceeding well, and shall be recompenced of his Lord. It is lawfull for you to eat of all clean Beasts, except of such as have been heretofore prohibited: Depart from the pollution of Idols; beware of bearing false witnesse, and be obedient to God. He that saith, God hath a Companion, is like to him that fell head-long from Heaven, whom the Birds devoured, and the wind cast into a remote place, full of miseries. He that shall reverence the signes of the power of God, will not doubt of his Law, and shall be rewarded for his good works at the time appointed. If he visit the old Temple of Mecca. We have given to all Nations of the world a Law to offer their Sacrifices, and to return thanks to their Lord, for having given them advantage above all sorts of Beasts. Your God is one God, obey his Commandements, proclaim a great reward to them that are obedient to him, to them that tremble ^ith fear, when they hear mention of his name; that are patient in their adversity, that pray at the time appointed, and dispence in alms some part of the wealth that we have given them. We have created the female Camel for a sign of our unity, she shall be profitable to you in this world. Remember to pronounce the name of God, when ye shal sacrifice her, standing on her feet, when she shall fall dead on the ground, eat of her flesh, if it like you, and give to eat to such as shall require it. We have made her subject to you;The Pilgrims Sacrifice a Cammel at MECCA. pera^venture ye wil be thankful to me for this grace. God promoteth before him, neither the flesh of this Beast, nor the blood, but only the good works that ye perform. He hath  thus subjected it; That ye may exalt it, and give him thanks for having guided you into the right way. Proclaim to the righteous, That God will remove far from them the malice of the wicked; he abhorreth Traytors, and the ingratefull: Declare to such as fight against Infidels, to repair the injury they have don them; that God is sufficiently powerfull to protect them. When they were driven from their houses without reason; they said, God is our Lord: Had not God stirred up the people against each other, the Covents of the Religious, the Churches of the Christians, the Synagogues of the Jews, and the Temples of the Believers, had been ruined, (through the multitude of the wicked,See Gelaldin. and their malice.) The name of God is exalted in the Temples of believers, and therein is his Law defended and protected. God is most strong; he hath all power over his people. Those whom God hath established on Earth, with victory over their enemies, make their prayers in the maner ordained; pay Tythes, and enjoyn to do what is honest and civill; forbid to do what is prohibited of God, who knoweth the end of all things. If the Infid^ls traduce thee, their predecessors traduced Noah, A^d, Chiab, Abraham, and Lot, they also slandred Mos^s: God for a time deferred their punishment, but in the end most severely chastised them. How many Cities have we destroyed, because of their impiety? We have overthrown, and made them desart, through the death of their Inhabitants. Shall those of Mecca walk for ever upon Earth* with an hard heart, without reflecting upon what hath heretofore befalne the Infidels? Their eyes are not blinde, but their hearts are blinde, and hardned: They will require thee to cause the wicked to be speedily chastised; God will not go against what he hath promised: One day before thy Lord, is as a thousand yeers before men. How often hath the punishments of impi^us Cities been deferred, that in the end were destr^yed? The whole world shall one day be assembled before me, to be recompenced after their merits. Say unto them, O people! I preach unto you publikely the torments of Hell, such as shall believe, and do good works,  they shal receive pardon of their sins, and a precious treasure; they that shall endevor to make voyd the faith shal be damned. We sent our Prophet to read only our Commandments to the People; the unbeleivers read many things that are not in the Alcoran; but God hath made vain what the Devil had there inserted, and confirmed the precepts of his Law: What the Devill there inserted, serveth for sedition to them that are weak in their faith, and have an heart the Infidels are in an exceeding great error, and are far from the Truth. Such as have the knowledg of Scripture, know that the Alcoran is truth it self, which proceedeth from thy Lord: They beleive in it, and humble their heart in reading it. God guideth into the right way such as beleive in the truth: The Infidels shall be in doubt, untill they be surprized of the day of Judgement. That day shall they be rigorously chastised, that day shall God command, and judg the good and the bad; the righteous that shall have beleived, and done good works, shall enter into delicious Gardens; and the Infidells that shall have disobeyed his Commandments, shall suffer exceeding great torments,See Gelaldin. They that departed from Mecca, and went to Medina, to abandon the society of unbeleivers, and were slain; or died of sicknesse, shall be rewarded of his divine Majesty. God is the greatest benefactor in the world? he shal give them to enter where they shall desire; he is omniscient, and most merciful. The believers that shall take revenge of the injury that the unbeleivers have done them, shall be protected of God; He is gracious and merciful towards his people; he maketh day to enter into night, and night into day; he heareth the Prayers of True beleivers, and seeth whatsoever they do and will protect them, because he is truth it selfe. Idols are but vanity; and God is most high, and omnipotent. Dost thou not consider that God sendeth the rain from Heaven, and that the earth becommeth green? He is benign to his people, and knoweth all [things;] whatsoever is in Heaven and Earth, is his; he hath no need of his people and ought to be exalted. Seest thou not that God hath subjected to you all the beasts that are upon the Earth? Seest thou not that the ship runneth upon the SEA, through his command, to  transport you and your substance? Seest thou not, that he hindreth heaven to fal upon the earth? certainly he is benign, and merciful; He it is that hath given you life and death, he shal make you to dy, and shall raise you againe, neverthelesse man is ingrateful for his favors. We have given a Law to all the Nations of the World, to guide them into the right way; if they observe it they will not dispute against thee. Invoke thy Lord, thou art in the right way; if they dispute against thee: Say unto them, God knoweth all your actions, he shal judg your differences at the day of judgment: knewest thou not that God knoweth whatsoever is in heaven or in earth? All is written, and this is most easie to his divine Maj. Idolaters adore without reason, Idols that understand not whether they be gods or no, that shall be without protection at the day of Judgment; when they preach to men my commandements, they know by their countenance those that are impious, and ingratefull for my graces; they would with wrath fall upon them that instruct them. Say unto them, I declare unto you things more greivous: God hath prepared the fire of hell to chastise Infidels. O people! A parable is related to you, hear it. All the Idolls that ye adore cannot create a flye; when they shall be assembled to do it, if the flies corrupt any thing that is offered to them, they have not the power to drive them away, because of their impotency, and the weaknesse of them that adore them: They praise not God in that manner as is just and reasonable, he is most strong, and most powerfull, he hath chosen messengers to bear and and execute his Commandements among Angels and men, he heareth whatsoever they say, beholdeth whatsoever they do, he knoweth whatsoever they have don, and all things obey him. O ye that believe! honor and worship your Lord, and do good, perhaps, ye shall be blessed; Fight for the establishment of his Law with affection, he hath chosen you to follow it, he hath not given you a Law heavy and troublesom. It is the Law of Abraham your father, he hath stiled you the Resigned to God; before the coming of the Alch^ran. The Prophet shall testifie against  you at the day of judgment, and ye shal testifie against the people, that the Prophet hath preached to them the right way; persevere in your prayers, pay tithes, and trust in God, he is your Lord your Prophet and your protector.   CHAP. XXIII. The Chapter of True Believers, containing an hundred and eighteen verses, written at Mecca. I the Name of God, gracious and merifull. Certainly the True beleivers shall be blessed, that make their prayers with humility; they abstain from reviling, they pay tithes, they commit not whoredom, they touch not other women, then their own, and their slaves, such as covet other, transgresse the bounds of reason; they that faithfully preserve what hath been intrusted to them, they that effect what they have promised, and that make their prayers at the time appointed, shall be heirs of Paradise, where they shall dwell eternally. We formed man of the dust of the earth, with mire blood congealed, with a little flesh and bones, which we invested with skin; we another time created him, when we breathed into him, the soul in the body, and blessed him, as one of our fairest ornaments. O men! ye shall all dye, and shall rise again at the day of judgment; we created above you seven heavens,See Gelaldin. and have care of the conservation of al people that are beneath, we send water from heaven to satisfy your necessities; we make it to fall upon the earth, and have power to cause to passe away and deprive you [of it.] We have created, and made gardens to bring forth Date trees, Grapes and many other fruits, by which ye live; we created trees in the mountain of Sinai, that produce oyl, and Or dying Colours. tincture; ye receive great advantage by beasts, they sustain you with milk, and afford you many other proffits, ye mount them, and ships also carry you whither ye desire to go. We sent Noah who spake to the people, and said, worship one God alone, what other God wil ye implore but him? Will ye not fear  to worship another? The chief among the people that were idolaters, said to their adherents, this man is a man like your selvs, he would appear, and be esteemed more then you; if God would be adored alone, as he saith, he would cause an angel to descend, that should bring his Commandments; we have not heard spoken to our Predecessors, what he saith; he is a man possessed of the Devil, tarry, and ye shal see what will become of him. Then Noah said, Lord, protect me against them, and defend me from their blasphemies; we commanded him to build an Ark, when our commandment was given to destroy the wicked, and when the water of his caldron boyled, we commanded him to enter into the Ark, with two beasts of every kinde, and species; all men we destroyed, except them of whom we have before spoken, (we said unto him) speak not to me for Infidels, they shall be drowned, when thou shalt have taken order for every thing that must enter into the Ark, with thee, Say, praise be to God, who hath delivered us from the malice of the wicked, Lord, give us to descend in a blessed place, thou art the best Pilot in the world. It was a sign of my omnipotency to prove the people of Noah, we created after them another people, to whom we sent an Apostle, to instruct them to worship one God; and he said, what God will ye adore other then God? will ye not feare his wrath? Their Doctors that were impious, who denyed the Resurrection of the flesh, and on whom we had conferred the wealth of the Earth, said, he is a man, he eateth and and drinketh like you, if ye obey not a man like to your selves, ^hall ye be destroyed? doth he promise you to return into the world, after having been bones and dust? O abuse! O abuse! ye are abused in what he promiseth, he is a man like other^, he is a lyar, we will not beleive him. That apostle said, Lord, preserve me from their blasphemyes, they shal repeat suddenly of their impiety, then thunder surprised them, and destroyed them, as they deserved, we made the land dry and barren without fruit, and created other persons in the^^ place. Man cannot die before his hour, and none can retard it; we sent our Apostles, and our Prophets to instruct the peopl, but they were slain one after another, every  Nation traduced the Prophet that we sent to them, and we made them serve for examples to posterity, and destroyed the wicked. We sent Moses and his brother Aaron to Pharoah, and his Doctors, with our miracles, and with most intelligible reasons; they arose against the Faith, they tormented the children of Israel, and said, shall we believe in a man like to our selves, of them that obey us? They slandred both of them, and were in the number of the damned. We gave to Moses the Book of the Law, peradventure it wil guide the children of Israel into the right way; we created Jesus, and Mary his mother, they are signs of our Unity; we established them in an eminent place, where they stayed neere a fountaine. O Apostles and Prophets! eat of the frurts of the earth, and do good, I know whatsoever ye do, your Law is one law, and I alone am your Lord; take heed to your selvs, follow not the law of the Infidels, every one liketh what he doth, depart fro^ the wicked and leave them in their errors, an accompt shal be required of the^ of the riches, and of the children that we have given them but they know it not. Such as fear the punishment of their Lord, that obey his Commandements, profes his unity, give Alms of the substance that he hath given them, and feare in their hearts, that they are not acceptable to them, shall appear in his presence; such as shall obey him, shall enjoy his grace; he requireth not of any man what he is unable to performe. We have a booke that declareth the truth, no injustice shall be done to him that shall doe what he is able; certainly the Infidels are in ignorance of the Alcoran, they act what is quite contrary, to that which is commanded true believers; but we have punished the chief among them in their prosperity. Be not this day resolute, ye shall not be protected of us. Our Commandments are taught you, neverthelesse ye are returned upon your steps, and are risen against the Faith, and in discoursing by night, withdrew your selvs from the righteous. Consider they not the words [of the Alcoran?] ^oth it contain any thing that hath not bin ordained to their predecessors; know they not the Prophet that God hath sent to them? Wherefore will they not acknowledg him? Will they say  that he is possessed of the devil? On the contrary, he reacheth them the truth, neverthelesse the greatest part of them detest him; if their will had place, heaven and earth, and whatsoever is betwixt them should be confounded; we have instructed them in the Law which they ought to observe, but they have renounced it; Dost thou require of them any recompence for thy instructions? Thy Lord shall reward thee, there is none that is of power to recompence thee better then He. Call them to the right way; such as shall not believe the Resurrection, shall err. If we pardon and deliver them from affliction, they will still continue in their errors, to their confusion; we heretofore chastised them, neverthelesse they humble not themselves, neither implored their Lord; and when we opened upon them the gate of our Judgements, they became desperate. God hath given you sight, hearing, and sense, but few among you return him thanks, he it is that hath created you of earth, ye shall one day be assembled before him to be judged; he it is that giveth life and death, and maketh the difference of day and night, will you not honor him, neither consider? On the contrary, they have said, as did their predecessors, wherefore shall we die? our bones shall be dust, and shall we rise again? This was heretofore promised to our fathers, and to us; certainly it is but an old song; Say unto them, to whom appertaineth the earth, and whatsoever is in the earth, if ye know [its Creator and King?] They will say, it is Gods; Say unto them, know ye not then, that he that created y^u can raise you again? who is Lord of the seven heavens? who possesseth the throne of heaven? they will say, it is God; say unto them, will ye not fear then to worship any other God but him? Say unto them, who is King of all things? who sustaineth them, and is sustained of none? They will say, that it is God; Say unto them, why then do ye deceive your selves? we have taught them the truth, but they have rejected it, and said, that God had a sonne; were there another God with God, the one would undoe what the other hath done, and they would rise the one against the other. Praised be God, what they affirm is not true, God knoweth that is past, the  present, and the future, he hath no companion: Say, Lord, give me o see the effect of all that thou hast promised to them, and put me not among the unjust, deliver us from evill, and do good to us, I know their impiety; Lord deliver me from the temptations of the devill, deliver me from their malice; when any one among them dieth, he saith, Lord, permit me to return into the world, I will do better then I have done; there is no return, it is to speak in vain, there is an obstacle behinde them, that detaineth them untill the day of Judgment; when the Trumpet shall sound, nothing shall retard them, they shall not glory, nor discourse with each other: the ballance of the blessed shall be heavy with good works, and the ballance of the cursed shal be light of good works. Have not my Commandments beene preached unto you, wherefore did ye contemn them? They shall say, Lord, our misery prevailed over us, we were mislead, Lord deliver us from this misery, the contrary was promised to us, truly we are exceedingly too blame. It shall be said unto them, depart into the fire, and never speak to come out. Many of them that worship me, say, Lord, we believe in thee, pardon our sins, thou art mercifull. Ye have derided them, O yee wicked! and have despised my Commandements, but I will reward them for their perseverance, and they shall be blessed. It shall be said to those that rise again, how many years have ye remained in the earth? they shall answer, we have bin there a day, or some dayes, aske of the Angels appointed to keep the accompt, ye have bin there but a little time, did ye not know it, do you believe that I have created, and assembled you before me in vain? Praise and exalt God, King of Truth, there is no God but be, he is King of Heaven: he is void of reason that invoketh another God with Him, he shall give accompt of his actions, and the Infidells shall be miserable: Say, Lord, pardon the sins of the righteous, thou art the great mercifull.    CHAP. XXIV. The Chapter of Light, containing seventy and foure Verses, written at Medina. IN the Name of God, gracious and mercifull. We have sent this Chapter containing our Commandments clear and intelligible, peradventure ye will learn them. The Is a man or boy kept unlawfully. Catamite and the Concubine shall be whipt with an hundred stripes; take heed lest clemency cause you to forget the precepts of the Law of God, believe in his divine Majesty, and the day of Judgement; Some of the True-believers shall be witnesses of their punishment: The Catamite lying with a Concubine, or an Infidell, the Concubine lying with a Catamite or Infidell, these things are forbidden the True believers. He that shall accuse an honest woman of adultery, shall be whipt with twenty four stripes, unlesse he prove his accusation by four witnesses, and shall never be credited in testimony. They that do such things, are without the obedience of God, except those that repent, and satisfie what they owe, God shall be to them gracious and mercifull. They that shall accuse their Wives of adultery, and have no witnesses, shall swear four times that they speak the truth, and shall the fifth time call for the curse of God to be upon them, if they be lyars. The Wife shall be exempt from punishment, if she swear four times that her husband is a lyar, and if the fifth time she pray that the wrath and indignation of God may be upon her,See Gelald^n. if what her husband hath said be true; In this manner doth God gratifie you, that ye may understand the truth, he is most gracious and most wise. That Troup that made defection from the True-believers with a lye, and false testimony, did you no harme; on the contrary, they did advantage you; every one shall bear the burden of his sinnes, the most m^licious among them shall be thrown headlong into the torments of Hel;This is Abdallabin Selouk. It was an happinesse that ye heard the sense of the believers from their own mouth, when the said,  that those men lyed impudently; if they had not presented those four witnesses, they had found none other,One of Mahomets wives was accused of adultery with Safoiian, by Mahomets enemies. they are lyers, without the grace and mercy of God, they should have already felt great torments in this world and in the other, because of that imposture: When they spake of what they were ignorant, ye deemed it to be nothing, but it is an exceeding sin before God, if when ye heard it, yee said, that to speak of those things did not concerne you, ye knew it to be an imposture, God forbiddeth you to relapse, if ye beleive in his Law, he thus declareth to you his pleasure, he is omniscient and most prudent; Such as desire to cast obloquie among the True believers, sha^l be rigorously chastised in this world, and in the other, God knoweth that of which you are ignorant: Had not God bin favourable to you, he had chastised you in burning fury, he is gracious and mercifull. Oh ye that are Tru-believers! follow not the footsteps of the Devill, he will enjoyn you vice and sin; had not God gratified you with his mercy, not any among you should have been purged from that imposture, but God purifieth whom he seeth good, he beareth all and hnoweth all your intentions. The most rich and powerfull among you have not sworn to do no good to their parents, the poor, or to them that fight for the law of God, neverthelesse they do it not to them, and flie them; desire they not that God should pardon them? He is neither gentle nor pitifull but towards True-belivers. They that accuse of immodesty, women chast, innocent, and faithfull, shall be accursed in this world, and shall suffer great torments at the day; when their tongues, their hands and their feet shall testifie ageinst them; at the same time shall God pay to them what shall be due unto them without injustice, and they shall know that God is truth it selfe. The wicked women shall speak as the wicked men, and the wicked men as the wicked women: The good [women] shall speak as the good [men] and the good [men] as the good women; the good are innocent of the imposture of the wicked, they shall injoy the grace of God, and the treasures of Paradse. Oh ye that are True-beleivers! enter  not into anothers house without permission, if ye salute them that dwell there, ye sh^ll do well; peradventure ye wil be mindfull, if ye find none of the house enter not without permission, if they speak to you to returne, ye shall return, it is better (then to stay at the door) God beholdeth all that ye do, ye shal not offend God to enter into houses inhabited, if ye have affairs there, God knoweth all your intentions. Speak unto the true-believers, that they contain their sight, that they be chast, that they do good, and that God knowes all their action. Speak unto the True-beleiving women* that they retain their fight, and that they be chast, that they suffer nothing of their beauty to be seen, but what ought to be seen, that they cover their bosome, and their vissage, that they permit them not to be seene, but by their husbands, their Children, the Children of their husbands, their brothers, their nephew^, their sisters, their women, their daughters, maid-servants and slaves by their domestiques, that are not capable of marriage, by children that regard not the beauty of Women, and that they move not their feete, to shew they are well shod. Implore pardon of God, peradventure ye shall be happy; many maidens of your owne Religion, the daughters of the righteous, or your slaves, if they be poor, God shall enrich them with his grace, he is most liberall and omniscient. Such as have not means to marry, shall live chastly, untill God hath given them means: Such as have desire to marry their slaves, shall have power to passe a contract of marriage, if they know them to be wise, and shall give them part of the wealth that God hath bestowed on them, despise not your wives that are chast, to commit whoredom; if ye desire good in this world, if yee contemne them God shall be to them propitious and mercifull; we have sent to you these precepts, clear and intelligible, like to them that were taught your Prede^essours, to be preached to the righteous; God illuminateth the heaven and the Earth, as the Lamp that is in the Lanthorn of of Chrystall, fed with oyl of the blessed Olive. It seemeth to be a Star full of light, which goeth neither to the West, nor the East, and yeildeth brightness  upon brightness; God guideth by his light whom it pleaseth him, he teacheth his people parables, and is omniscient, ^e permitteth you to praise him in your houses, there to be mindfull of his name, and to exalt him evening and morning. Oh ye men! your affairs ought not to hinder your remembrance of his divine Majesty, to make your prayers at the time appointed, neither to pay Tithes. Fear the day when the hearts of men shall be perplexed, and their fight troubled, when God shall reward and chastise every one after his works, and shall augment his grace upon the good; he enricheth with his innumerable benefits whom to him seemeth good. The good works of the wicked are like to mists in a spacious pl^in, they seem to be water, when afar off, and being appreache^, nothing is to be there found; They shall finde before God the book, wherein is written whatsoever they have don, he shall punish them according to their dem^rits, he is exact to keep accompt. Their actions are moreover like to the darkness that is in the bottom of the sea, that is covered with wave upon wave, obscurity and darknesse upon one another, he that is in this darknesse cannot see his hand; he that shall not be illuminated by God, sha^l not see a jot; Seest thou not, that whatsoever is in Heaven and Earth exalteth the glory of God? The Birds extend their wings before him to praise him, he heareth the prayers of all his creatures, and understandeth the prayses that they give him, he knoweth all that they do, he is King of Heaven and Earth, the refuge of all the world* Soest thou not how he assembleth the clouds? how he plac^th them one upon another? considerest thou not how the rain falleth through their pores? and that God causeth fresh water to descend from the mountains? He hath given it to whom seemeth good to him, he causeth the brightnes of lightning to approach men, which blindeth their sight, and overwhelmeth the day with night; These things are signes of his omnipotency, to them that consider them; He created of a little water, all sorts of living Creatures; some creep upon the Earth, others walk upon two feet, and others upon four; he created what pleased hi^, he is omnipotent. Certainly, he hath sent a law clear and intelligible,  to conduct into the right way whom it shall seeme good to him. The Infidels say, We beleive in God, and his Prophet; nevertheles a party among them abandon his Law, and believe not in his divine Majesty: when they are called before God, and before the Prophet, to judge their differences, many among them refuse to come; if they come, it is with contempt. They are greatly afflicted at heart, do they fear that God and his Prophet will do them injustice? On the contrary, they themselves are unjust. When the True-beleivers are called before God, and the Prophet to be judged; they s^^, We have heard and obeyyed, they are not ignorant. Th^se that shall obey God, and his Prophet, shall be bless^d. Many swear to fight gallantly for the Faith, when they shall be commanded to march against the enemy, say unto them, Swear not, your obedience to the Prophet shal be pref^rred to your Oaths, God knoweth whatsoever ye do; say unto them, Obey God, and his Prophet; if they be disobedient, they shall bear their burden, and ye shall bear your own; if ye obey, ye shall follow the right way. The Prophet is obliged only to preach intelligibly God promised to the True beleivers, that shal do good works, that they shall live long up-upon e^rth, as he promised to them that were before them, that they might establish the Law that he gave them; he shall change their fear into assurance; he shal deliver them from terror, that they may adore him alone, without companion. He that is wicked, will depart from the obedience which he oweth to God: Make your prayers at the time appointed, pay Tithes, and obey the Prophet, God shall give you his mercy. Beleive not that the Infidels are more powerfull on Earth than We; they shall be precipitated into the fire of Hell. O ye that are True-beleivers! your slaves and servants of Free-condition shall require leave of you, to enter where ye shall be thrice, viz. Before the prayer at break of day, after noon, and after supper, they shall not offend in entring without leave, where ye shall be at another time: they enter there to serve you. In this manner doth God teach you his Commandments, he knoweth the humor of his Creatures, and is most prudent in all  that h^ ordaineth. It is ordained to your children, when they shall be at age of discretion, to demand of you permission to do what they shall desire, as did your pred^cesso^s: Thus doth God teach you his Commandments; he is gracious and mercifull. The old and d^cr^pit women shall not offend God, to quit their vails, and discover their faces; provided it be without vanity, and design to shew their ornaments: If they abstain, they shall do well, God hea^eth whatsoever ye say, and knoweth all that is in your he^rts. The blinde, the lame, the sick,See Kitab el tenior. and you also, shall not sin, to eat in the house of your children; at the house of your Father and Mother, brothers, sisters, Vncles, Aunts, Friends; and in the house of your servants; ye shall not offend God, if ye eat together, or apart. When ye shall enter into any house, salute each other from God, with blessing and affection. Thus doth God teach you his Commandments, peradventure you will learn them. When those that believed in God, and his Prophet, repaired to the Prophet, they retired not without his permission. Such as required leave (to depart) believe in God, and his Prophet; if they require leave of thee for any businesse, licence whom shall seem good to thee, and p^ay to God for them;See Kitab el tenoir. he is gracious and mercifull. Call not the Prophet, as ye call one anothe^ among you: God knoweth such as shame ully depart out of the Temple, and the French. Such as disobey his Commandments, ought to take he^d, least some mischiefe befal them, and that they suffer not great tormen^s; Whatsoever is in the Heavens, or on Earth, is Gods, he knoweth if ye are zealous in your faith,See Gelaldin. or be hyp^crites; ^e knoweth the day wherein a^l th^ wor^^ shall be assembled bef^re him [to be j^dged.] ^n th^^ d^y shall men see what what they have done; he knoweth all things.    CHAP. XXV. The Chapter of the Alcoran, containing seventy and seven Verses, wrinten at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and merciful: praised be he that sent the Alcoran to his servant to instruct the world; he is King of the Heavens and Earth; he hath no Son, nor Companion in his rign; he created and ordained every thing. The Infidels worship Gods that can create nothing, and are things created; they can neither do them good nor evil, they can give neither life nor death, neither cause them to rise again. They say that the Alcoran is but a fable of thine invention, invented with the assistance of some other person; but they lye and blaspheme. They say that it is but an old Song, and a fable of the Ancients that thou writ^st, and that thou studiest morning and evening. Say unto them, it was sent by him that knoweth all ^hings in Heaven and Earth, alt^gether gracious and mercifull. They said, wh^ is this Prophet? He eateth bread and meat, and walketh th^ough the streets; we will not beleive him, unlesse an Angell descend from heaven to preach to us with him, unles that Angel enrich him, and that he have a Garden full of good and savory fruits; he is but a wizard, or one possesed of the Devil. Consider to what they compare thee; certainly they are in error, and cannot find the right way. Praise and bless him, that is able to bestow on thee a greater good, when it shall seem good to thee, to wit, Gardens, wherein flow many Rivers, and houses of pleasure. They have denyed the certainty o^ Universall Judgment, and we have prepared the fire of Hell to punish them; wrath shall carry them away with terrible cryes: when they shall behold the place of the assembly of judgment; when they shall there appear, they shall be desperate, and shall cry, O misery! Cry not O misery, cry O mis^ries! (in the Plu^al) ask of them which is better, and more advantagious, that, or paradise, which is prepared for the recompence of the righteous, where  they shall dwell e^ern^lly with al manner of felicity; this is it that God hath pro^ised, and that which was impetrated of his divine Majesty, (for them that have his fear be^or their e^es) I wil one day ass^mble I dolate^s, with their i^^ls; God shall say unto them, you are they who have seduc^d my creatures from the right way. They shall say, praised be thy name: we ought to have worshipped non^ but thy divine Majesty, but the weal^h that thou gav^st to our Magistrates, and their life, which thou did prolong, caus^d them to fo^get thy Commandment^, they were pernicious men, in that they a^jured thy Law, they cannot this day be exempt from the punishment of our crim^s, neither protect us against thy wrath. The Idolaters shall be rigorously punished The Prophets that we sent bef^re thee, did eat bread and meat, and walked through the streets: we prove them one after another: Persevere, God beholdeth them that are patient. Those that beleive not in the R^sur^ect^on, have s^id, The Angels are n^t ^escended from Heaven, we have not seene G^d, they are become proud, and are fallen into an exceeding great error but the wicked shal one day be without comf^rt, when they see the Angel, they shal cry, help, help! We will set before their eyes all the sins that they have commi^ted, the good works which they shal think to hav^ do^, shall be like to dust, which the Winde carryeth away, and the blessed shall enjoy a most certain good, they shall hear of nothing but what contenteth them. When the Heaven and the aire shall divide themselves, and the Angels shall descend, then shall the truth appear, and the mercifull shall raigne, that day shall be tedious to Infidels, they shall bite their fingers, and sa^, would to God I had f^llowed the Prophet and his Apostle! Oh misery! would to God I had not contracted amity with such an Infidell he seduced me from the right way, he hind^ed me to beleive in the A^coran which God sent, certainly the Devill hath tempted men, Then shall the Prophet say, Lo^d, such as have followed me, have obe^ed what is written in the Alcoran, and the Infidells have rejected it we have appointed an enemy among the  wicked, to every Prophet of them that were before thee, but it sufficeth thee that God guideth and protecteth thee. The Infidels have dema^ded, it the Alcoran was sent all at once; I have so done to confirme the truth in thy heart, I have sent it piece by piece, they shall not shew thee any thing like unto it; I have instructed thee in the truth clear and intelligible, the incredulous shall be confined in the fire of Hell, and be most miserable. Certainly, We gave to Moses the book of the Law, we sent with him hi^ brother Aaron to assist him, and said unto them, Goe bo^h of you, p^each unto Infidells, we will destroy them, unless they be converted. When the people of Noah despised our Commandment, we drowned them, and made them sure for example to posterity, and prepared great torments for the impious. Remember Aad, T^mod, and those that dwelt nigh unto the well, a long time af^er them; we spake to them in parables, and destroyed them. Oh ye wicked! consider the misery of t^e City, upon which fell that mischievous rain, that destroyed them, because the Inhabitants believed not in the Resurrection. When the Infidels saw thee appear, they d^^ided thee, and said, This Prophet would seduce us, and make us to abandon our God, We had patience, and deferred our punishment: they shall know at the day of Judgement them that have bin seduced; Hast thou considered the action of him that spake of his God after his fantasie? Wert thou his Tutor, to hinder him to speak? Dost thou believe that the greatest part of the wicked heare, and understand what thou speakest to them? They are like beasts, and worse; Seest thou how thy Lord sheddeth the Rose, were it his will, it should be permanent, the Sun hath caused it to melt, and attracteth it gently to himself. He it is that created the night for repose, and the day for labour. He it is that sendeth the winds by his special grace, he maketh rain to descend from Heaven, to refresh the Earth, to give it life, to water the beasts, and for the contentment of men; we have divided it among them, that they may be mindful of our grace, nevertheless, the greatest part of them are ungratefull. Had we so pleased,  we had sent to every City a Preacher, to preach unto the Inhabitants the torments of hell; obey not Infidels, preach to them frequently what is written in the Alcoran It is God that hath sweetned the water of Euphrates, that joyned the two Seas, that made them fa^t, and put between them a separation, to hinder them to mix: He created man and woman of a little water, to increase and multiply together; thy Lord can do whatsoever him pleaseth, yet do the Infidels adore what can neither hen^ fit nor hurt them, and assist the Devil their master to tempt the world We sent thee only to pr^ach the torments of hel and to proclaime the joyes of Paradise: Say unto them, I require not of you a reward for my preaching, he that shall be acceptable to God, will follow the way of his Law: Praise and exalt thy Lord, trust in him, he knoweth all the sins of men; he created the heavens, and the earth in six days, and sitteth on his Throne; learn this of him that knoweth it. When it w^s s^id to the Infidels, worship the merciful [God;] they s^id, what merciful? shal we worshipp what ye appoint us? and they added to their impiety. Blessed be he that created the signs of heaven, that created the Sun, and the Moon, ful of brightnesse and light, and hath made the days to succeed each other, to returne him thanks for his graces. The servants of the mercifull that walk with humility, that salute the ignorant when they speak to them; Such as pray to* and worship God day and night; such as say Lord* deliver us from the torment of hell; those that fear God, that are not prodigall, nor covetous, that folow the middle way, betwixt prodigality and avarice, those that worship one God, that kill no man but with reason, and following the Commandments of God, and that are not luxurious, shall injoy eternally the grace of God; such, as do the contrary shal be chastised, their punishment shall be augmented at the day of Iudgment, and they shall be damned for ever, except him that shal be converted, and shall have don good works, God shal give him pardon of his sins, he is gratious and mercifull. They, who do good works and repent, who make no false O^th who are humble, and are not (wilfully) deaf and dumbe  when they heare the Alcoran read, and say, Lord, give us and our posterity children, that may be the light of our eyes, and be obedient to thee; work in us a fear to disobey thy Commandements; such persons shall enjoy eternally the delights of Paradise, for reward of their perseverance; they shal there find salutations, and benedictions, with immense graces. Say unto the wicked, God will not enlighten you, neither hearken to your prayers, because yee have traduced his Prophet; the time of the punishment of your c^imes shall suddenly arrive.   CHAP. XXVI. The Chapter of Poets, containing an hundred and twenty seven Verses, written at Mecca. IN the Name of God, gracious and mercifull: God is most pure, he understandeth all things, he is most wise. These signs are the signs of the book that distinguisheth truth from falshood; wilt thou destroy thy self, because men are impious? If I will, I can cause my judgments to discend upon them, that shall humble them, they dispise my Commandments, they scoffe, but shall be rigorusly punished; see they not how many fruits we have made to spring out of the earth? It is a token of our omnipotencie, nevertheless the greatest part of them believe not that thy Lord is the omnipotent, and the merciful. Instruct them how thy Lord said unto Moses, thou shalt be my Messenger to the Infidels, and the people of Pharoah, that they may have my fear before their eyes.Moses slew an Egyptian. Moses said, Lord, I fear they may traduce me, and that my tongue cannot be loosed; send with me my brother Aa^on, they know the fault I have committed, and will put me to death. The Lord said to him, they shall not put thee to death, go both whither I command you, I wil be with you, and will hear what they say; say to Pharoah, that ye are the M^ssengers of the Lord of the world, and let him dismiss with you the children of Israel; Pharaoh said unto Moses, have I not seen thee within this house a little childe? Didst thou not dwell with us many years? Didst thou not kill a  man? thou art impious. Moses said, I did what I did, I was in the number of the seduced, I fled when I feared you; since that time God hath given me knowledg, and placed me in the number of his Prophets and Apostles, he hath sent me his grace, to set before thee the evill that thou dost commit, in causing thy selfe to be adored of the children of Israel; Pharoah said unto him, who is that God of the world? he answered, it i^ the Lord of Heaven, and Earth, and of whatsoever is between them. Pharoah said to them that were about him, Hear ye not what he saith? Moses continued his [speech] and said, my Lord is your God, the God of your Fathers, and of your predecessors. Pharoah said, this Prophet that is sent to you is a fool; Moses said, I am indeed the Mess^^ger of the Lord of the West and East, if ye had understanding to know him: Pharoah said, if thou worship any other God but me, I will cause thee to be put unto the bottom of a pit; Moses said to him, wilt thou do it, seeing I am come to thee with reasons so strong, and arguments so infallible? Pharoah said unto him, bring thy reasons if thou art true: Then he cast his staffe on the ground, and it was changed into a Serpent, he drew hi^ hand out of his bosom, it appeared white, and shining to the eyes of the spectators. Then said Pharoah to them that were about him, certainly, behold here a skilfull Magician, he would drive you from your Countrey through his magick, What say ye? They answered, he, with his brother must be terrified, and men must be sent into all thy Cities, to assemble the most knowing Magicians of all thy Dominions; when they came together at the day appointed, it was demanded of them, if they were called to follow the magick of Moses, and of Aaron? They said, what shall be our reward if we be victorious? Pharaoh said unto them, yes, ye shall be rewarded, and be among them that approach my person. Moses said unto them, wil you cast your staves on the ground, or shal I first cast mine? They cast th^ir cords and ^heir staves first, saying with the assistance of Pha^aoh we shall be victorious; then Moses cast his rod on the ground, w^h. devoured their cords and staves; when they beheld this miracle, they fel prostra  and said, we beleive in the Lord of the world, God of Moses and Aaron; Pharoah said to them, if ye beleive in Moses without my permission, ye shall see what shall befall you; he is your Master, he understandeth Magick better than you; I will cause your right feet and left hands, or your right hands and left feet, to be cut off, and cause you all to be hanged? they said, this shall do us none harm, we shal return before God our Lord, we hope that he wil remit our sin^, because we shal be the first converts. We said unto Moses, goe with Israel my servants, and fear not the people of Pharoah that shall follow thee: Pharoah sent his Commissioners through his Dominions to assemble the people, and said, (speaking of the children of Israell) those men are few in number, they have displeased me, but I will wel awake them. We moved Pharoah, and his people to depart out of Egypt, to pursue the children of Israel; we caused them to quit their gardens, fountaines, and houses of pleasure, and made the children of Israel heirs of their trea^ure, they surprized them at the rising of the Sun; when the children of Israel beheld them, they said we are ov^taken, Moses answered, no, my Lord is with me, he shall guide me, then we inspired Moses to strike the sea with his Rod, incontinently it divided it self on both sides, like two mountains; we saved him, and all that were with him, and drowned the men of Pharoah; which shall serve for an example to the incredulous and obstinate, the Lord is omnipotent and mercifull. Relate to unbeleivers the History of Abraham, when he said to his father and his people, whom do ye adore? they answered, we adore our Idols; he said unto them, do they hear you when ye invoke them? do they do good unto you when ye worship them, or mischeif when ye neglect them? they answered, we find that our fathers worshipped them as we do; Abraham said unto them, you and your fathers worship vain things, ye adore only Idols, mine enemies, I will not worship them, I will worshipp the Lord of the world, who created, guideth, and nourisheth me, who giveth me health when I am sick, who maketh me to live, and will cause me do dye, and from whom I  hope for pardon of my sins at the day of Judgement: Lord give me the knowledg of thy will, grant that my tongue and words may be credited as true, by posterity; put me into the number of the heirs of Paradise; pardon my Father, who hath bin in the number of the Erroneous, and make me not ashamed at the day of the Resurrection; at the day, when riches and children shall be u^profitable, except to such as shall have an heart estranged from impiety; God shall make the righteous to approach to Paradise, and the wicked to see hell: they shall say, can the Idols that ye adore save you? can they save themselves? They shall be, with you, their adherents, and the devils, thrown headlong into the fire of hell. The Idolaters shall despute in hell, with them whom they have worshipped, and shall say, by God, we were abu^ed when we adored you, the wicked seduced us, we have none this day to intercede for us neither friend to protect us; could we return into the world, we would believe in the Law of God; this discourse shall be for example to the wicked that believe not that thy Lord is the Omnipotent and mercifull. The people of Noahs time slandered the Apostles and Prophets that were sent to them; N^ah th^ir brother said unto them, fear God, I am his Messenger, sent to preach unto you; fear God, and obey him, I ^equi^e no recompence for my Instructions, God the sole Lord of the world shall reward my labours, fear and obey him; They said, shall we believe in thee, and thy followers, who are infamous? He said, I know not what they do, my Lord k^epeth accompt of their actions; if ye knew ^he right way, ye would not worship Idolls; I drive not true believers from my society, I am sent only to preach the torments of Hell; They said, O Noah! if thou quit not this discourse thou shalt be stoned; Noah said, Lord, this people is impious, judge our difference, deliver me from their malice, and all true believers that are with me, We preserved him, and those that were with him in the A^k, and destroyed them that remained on the Earth: This is an Evidence of our Omnipotency, yet the greatest part of Infidels believe not that God is omnipotent and mercifull. The people  of Aads time traduced the Apostles and Prophets that were sent unto them; Hod his brother said unto them* fear God, I am his Messenger, sent to preach unto you with fidelity. Fear God and obey him, I require of you no recompense of my preaching, the Lord of the Universe shall abundantly reward me; Will ye build Towers, and lofty Pallaces, as if ye should dwel eternaly in the world? Will ye be cruel, without compassion on your selvs? fear God and obey him: fear him who giveth you his grace, bestoweth on you wealth, children, gardens, and fountains; I feare that ye shall suffer grievous paines at the day of Judgment: They said unto him, art thou come to be preached unto, or ^o preach to us? Thou relatest to us old mens Fables, They slandered him, and we destroyed them: this is a token of our Omnipotency, n^ver thel^sse the greatest part of Infidells beleive not thy Lord to be Omnipotent and merciful. The people of Temod belyed the Prophets that were sent unto them: his brother Salhe said unto them, fear God, I am a Messenger sent fro^ God to preach to you, fear God and ob^y him, I require of you no recompence for my preaching, the Lord of the Vniverse shal recompense my labours: will ye forsake ^ternal riches, to cleave to the wealth of this world, to put your trust in your gardens, your fountains, y^ur tillages, your dates, and fruits? shall ye be esteemed prudent if ye build houses of pleasure in the mou^tains? fear God, obey his Commandments, and obey not the wicked, that defile the earth, and do no good. They s^id unto him, thou art a Magician, and an Inchanter, thou art but a man like unto us, shew us some miracle, if thou be indeed a Prophet sent from God; he said: behold there a Camell,The Turks believe this Camel was changed into a rock by S^lhe. he hath a place to drink at a day appointed, ye likewise have it to drink as he, ^o him no harm, otherwise shal yee be punished at the day of Judgement. They did hurt this Camel through contempt, but ^ad cause to repent it, and were severely punished. This is an example for posterity: nevertheles the greatest part of Infidels beleive not that thy Lord is altogether gracious and merciful. The Citizens of Lot traduced  the Prophets that were sent unto them; Lot their brother said, fear God, I am a faithful Messenger sent from him, to preach to you, fear God, and obey him, I require of you no reward for my pains, God wil reward me; will ye cleave to the world, to reject that glory that he hath created for you? ye forsake good to imbrace evil. They said, O Lot! if thou change not this discourse, we wil banish thee from our City; he said, perhaps I am one of those whom ye abhor; Lord deliver me, with my family, from their hands. We saved him with al his family, except his Wife, who remained with the inhabitants of the City, we caused to fal upon them a rain that destroyed them. This is an example for posterity, nevertheles the greatest part of Infidels believe not that thy Lord is omnipotent and merciful. They that inhabit the A Forrest near to Madian Forrest, slande^ed the Prophets that were sent unto them: Chaib said to them, fear God, I am a faithfull messenger sent from him, to preach unto you the torments of Hel:See Gelaldin. fear God and obey him, I require no reward of you for my preaching, the Lord of tre Universe shal recompense me, Measure with good measure, and weigh with good weights, detain nothing from your neighbour, defile not the earth, fear him that created you, and al those that were before you They said unto him, thou art a forcerer, thou art but a man like us, we beleive thee to be a lyar: if thou art indeed sent from God, cause a part of Heaven to fall upon us, he answered, God knoweth that of which ye are ignorant, they traduced him, but were chastised: being covered with a cloud that rained upon them a shewer of fire, and they were burned, as if it had been the day of Iudgement: this is a token of my power, but the greatest part of Infidels beleive not that thy Lord is Omnipotent and merciful. Certainly the Alcoran was sent by the Lord of the world, the faithfull Spirit inspired it into thine heart, that thou mayst preach to the people the pains of Hell in the Arabique tongue; the Scriptures heretofore made mention [of it] if the Infidels of Mecca are ignorant of it, the Doctors of the Children of Israell have knowledge to understand it, although  that we have not sent it in the language of the Persians, yet cease not to instruct th^m in that which they know not; we have imprinted ^ lye in the hear^s of the wicked, they shall not believe what is written in the Alcoran, untill they see the punishment prepared for Infidels at the day of Judgment; that day shall come at unawares, of which they are ignorant. They say, let us tarry, and not believe as yet, in what is contained in that book, are they impatient untill they see their punishment? Hast thou seen how they have some years deferred it, and how, in the end, that which we promised befell them? their riches were to them unprofitable. We have not destroyed Cities without having forewarned them of their destruction, we are unjust to none. That devils did not bring the Alcoran, it was to them of none advantage, they could not compose it, they are re^n^te [from the Angels] and cannot hear their speech; say not there is another God with God; if thou say it, thou shalt be chastised; preach the torments of hell to them that shall follow thee; be humble and civill to true believers; if they disobey thee, say un^o them, I am innocent of what ye do* and am resigned to the Will of God, omnipotent and mercifull; He beholdeth thee when thou dost pray, and worship him; he heareth and knoweth all things. Shall I tel ye to whom the devils appresse hemselves? they apply themselves ^o lyars, they tell to them what they have heard spoken, but they all lye. The erronious imitate the Poets;See E^teri, and Kitab el tenoir. they are confuted in their discourse, and say, they have don what the^ have not, except those that believe in God that do good works, who often think of his divine Majesty, and that have been protected against the injustice of Infidels; the unjust shall know, that they shall one day rise again.    CHAP. XXVII. The Chapter of the Pismire, containing four-score and thirteen Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. God is most pure, he understandeth al. These mysteries are the mysteryes of the Alcoran, which distinguisheth the truth from a lye, it conducteth men into the right way, and proclaimeth the joyes of Paradize to such as beleive in the Law of God, who make their prayers at the time appointed, pay Tithes, and have knowledg of ^heir end. They that believe not in the day of Judgment, like well of wh^t they do, and are in confusion, they shall be in ^he number of the damned. The Alcoran was conveyd to thee from the most prudent, that knoweth all things* Remember thou that Moses? said to his family, I see a fire, I goe to it, I will bring you tydings, I will bring you a spark, peradventure you shall be warmed; When he drew near to the fire, h^ heard a voyce that said to him, oh Moses! that which is in this fire, and whatsoever is about it, is blessed; praise is due to God, Lord of the Vniverse; I am God omnipotent, and eternall: Cast thy staffe on the ground: When Moses beheld his staffe to move, as it had been alive, He went back very sorrowfull, and returned no more, Feare not that staffe, my messenger and my Prophets have no fear in my presence, he that shall be converted, shall finde me gracious and mercifull. Put thine hand into thy pocket it shal come forth white without harm, it shal be one of the nine marks of my omnipotency* Pharoah, and his Ministers were altogether erroneous; when they saw my Miracles, they said that th^y were but sorcery; they disposed them, and increased their impiety. Consider what is the end of the wicked, and how they have been destroyed? we gave knowledg to David and to Solomon, they said, God who hath gratifyed us above many of his servants that have beleivd in his omnipotency, Solomon was Davids  heire, and said to the people, we understand the Language of birds, we know whatsoever can be known, it is an exceeding great grace. Solomons Army being one day assembled before him, composed of men, Devils, and birds, he lead them to the valley of Pismires; a Pismire their Queen, cryed out, oh Pismires! enter into your houses, least Solomon and his troups trample you under foot, without knowledge of it. Solomon hearing these words, remained sometime without speaking, and in the end began to laugh, saying, Lord assist me, that I may give thee thanks for the benefits, and graces which thou didst conferr upon my Father; If I do well, thou wilt accept it, place me through thy mercy in the number of them that exalt thy glory; He called for the A Bird so called. Whoope, and said, wherefore see I not the Whoope? is she in the number of the absent? I will punish and put her to death, if she have not a l^^^^ll excuse; not long after, she humbled her selfe before Solomon, who asked her whence she came? she answered, I come from seeing what thou seest not, I come from the Kingdom of Saba, whence I bring certain tidings; I have found a woman, their Queen, who hath whatsoever is necessary for a King; she hath a great and magnificent Thron, I have found that she with her Subjects adore the Sun, the Devill caused them to delight in this their Action, he hath seduced them from the right way, and they shall be in Error untill they worship one God, who sendeth rain from Heaven, and maketh the earth to produce plants and fruits, who knoweth whatsoever is in the hearts of men, and what they utter; God! There is but one God, Lord of the Vniverse. Solomon said, I shall soon see if thou speak truth, or whither thou be in the number of the lyars, goe, bear to her this letter, and obs^rve what she and her people shall answer; At her arivall, the Queen said to her Ministers, Oh ye that are raised to dignity in my dominions! a Letter is given me from Solomon, of this tenour. In the name of God gracious and mercifull, rise not up against me, and obey me. Give me counsell, what I ought to do, I will do nothing without your advice, and what you see not with your eyes: They  answered, Our welfare and misery depend on thee, command whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and we will obey thee. She said, When Kings enter a City, they introduce many disorders; they abase, and humble the chiefe of the Inhabitants, and the most eminent; if Solomon and his people come hither, they will use [us] in the like maner. I think it requisit to send to him an Ambassador with some presents, perhaps he will take a resolution to return. When the Ambassador arrived in Solomons presence, he said unto him, Do ye bring me presents? God hath bestowed on me more riches then on you, presents rejoyce you, because ye love them: Return to them that sent you, I will go visit them with forces so great, that they shall not be able to resist; I will drive them out of their dominions, and they shall be miserable, if they obey me not: Then he said to his people, Sits, who will bring to me the Royall Seat of that woman, before she and her subjects obey me? One of the Devils said unto him, I, I will bring it before thou arise from thy place: I am strong enough to bear it, I will carry it carefully. One of them that attended S^lomon,Gelaldin saith he knew the name of God. who knew the Scriptures, said, I will bring it to thee in the twinkling of an eye: When Solomon beheld this Throne before him, he said, Behold here a favor of God, to try if ^ would acknowledg his benefits. He that returne^h thanks to God for his graces, performeth his duty; he rejecteth him that is ingratful. I will try if she followeth the right way, or whether she be in the number of the seduced. They changed something in her Royall seat, to try if she would know it, when she arrived in Solomons presence. At her arrival, they shewed it her, and asked if it resembled her own; she replyed, It resembleth it,This Quee was called Balkis. as if it were the same: She had knowledge of the right way; but that which the people, and she adored, instead of God, had seduced them from the obedience of his divine Majesty. They spake to her to enter into a gallery;See Gelaldin. when she beheld the pavement, she believed it to be water; and in lifting up her robe, fearing to wet it, discovered her Legg. Solomon told her, that the pavemen^ was of pollished glass, and exhorted her to embrace the  Law of God. Then she said, Lord, I am too blame, in having offended thee; I am obedient with Solomon, to the Commandments of the God of the Universe. We sent Salhe to Temod, and his people, to exhort them to worship one God: he said unto them, O people! flye to the mercy of God; if ye implore pardon of him, ye shal be pardoned. They said, wouldst thou draw us into thine error? and into the erro^, of them that are with the^? He said, God shall chastise you, ye are seditious. They were nine persons in the City that def^led the earth, and did no good; they said among them, Let us this night kill the Prophet, and his adherents: we will say to them that seeke him, That we saw him not, neither them that slew him; and will swear that we speak truth: They were cunning, but we were more subtle then they, and they knew it not. Consider what was the Issue of their stratagems: we destroyed them with their followers; and their houses are become desart, because of their impiety. This shall serve for example to them that have knowledge of Our omnipotency: We served the Proph^t, and all the True-beleivers that were with him: Remember then the History of Lot, who said to his Citizens, Will ye alway defile your selvs in uncleannesse, in each others veiw? will yee love men more then women? ye are ignorant. They replyed, Let us drive Lot and his family out of our City; they defile not themselvs like us, we preserved him, with all his family, except his wif^; she remained among them that were chastised. We caused it to rain upon them, a rain that gave them to know the severity of our chastisements. Say unto them, praised be God, that destroyeth the wicked, and salvation to all those who he hath chosen; are they not more happy, then such as beleive there are many Gods? who created the Heavens and the earth? who caused rain to fal from heaven* who hath made many delicious gardens to bring for^h? you have not the power to cause the plants to spring forth, without the assistance of God* certainly unbeleivers do erre fro^ the right way. Who hath established the earth, and made the rivers to flow? who hath made heavy the mountains? who but God hath put separation  that is between the Seas? The greatest part of the world know it not. Who rendreth men miserable? who delivereth them from affliction when they invoke him? who hath caused you to multiply, and leave your posterity on Earth, but God? Neverthelesse few men give him thanks. Who guideth in the darknesse of the Earth and Sea? who but God sendeth the windes, the forerunners of raine? he is most high, and m^st powerfull, but the wicked will not consider the effects of his omnipotency. Who formeth men? who maketh them to live, dye, and rise again? who enricheth them with the wealth of Heaven, and of Earth, but God? Say unto them, produce your reasons, bring your arguments, if what ye alleadg be true; Say unto them, none but God knoweth what is in Heaven and Earth, no man knoweth the future, present and past; do men know the day of the Resurrection? Contrarywise they doubt, and are blind. The wicked have said, what? we shall be dust, as are our fathers, and shall come forth out of our Graves! This was heretofore promised to our fathers, and to us, this is but a fable of old men: Tell them, that they consider not what was heretofore the end of the wicked; afflict not thy selfe, for that they conspire against thee, and that they demand at what time they shall see the punishment that is foretold them: Say unto them, it is not farre from you, ^e throw your selves headlong into it, but God is pitifull towards his people, neverthelesse the greatest part give him no thanks for his grace, thy Lord knoweth what is in their heart, and whatsoever they speak; there is nothing in Heaven or Earth, that is not written in a most intel^igible Book; the A^coran explaineth to the children of Israel the greatest part of their difficulties* it will guide them into the right way, and deliver from Hell them that shall believe thee, th^ Lord sh^ll judge them at the day of Judgment, he is omnipotent and wise; Trust thou in God, thou art in the way of truth; the dead and deafe shall not heare thee, and unbelievers shall depart from t^ee pensive and astonished, thou oughtest not to guide the blinde, neither to make the deaf to h^ar, except such as shall believe in the  Alcoran, and be obedient, when the time of the punishment that is denounced against them shall be come; we wil cause a Beast to com from under the earth, that shal speak unto them, and shall say, The people beleive not in the Law of G^d, they know not his wondrous works. Be thou mindfull of the day, when I will assemble a multitude of all Nations that have disobeyed my Commandments, to give accompt of their actions: I wil say unto them, ye have traduced my prophets, ye know not what ye said, what hove ye done? Then shall they be punished for their sins, and be inexcusable, they shall not speak a word. Do not infidels see that we have created the night for rest, and the day for travel? this is a sign of my Omnipotency; Be thou mindfull of the day wherein the Angell shall sound the Trumpet, and whatsoever is in Heaven or Earth, shall tremble with fear, except such as shall be in the favour of God; that day shalt thou see the Mountains suspended, to move like the Clouds, this shall be a work of God, who created all things, and knoweth their end; He that shall have done good works, shall be rewarded, he shall be without fear; and they that had don evil, shall remain in the fire of Hel; It shall be said unto them, are ye no: chastised according to your demerits? Say unto the people, I command you to worship the Lord of this priviledged Mecca. See Gelaldin. City, al things appertain to him; I command you to believe in the unity of his divine Maj. and to study the Alcoran, who so doth good, shal find good. Say unto them that shall be seduced, I am sent only to preach the torments of Hel. Say to true-believers, praysed be God that hath given you to see his Miracles, and hath given you knowledge of the right way; thy Lord is not ignorant of what they do.    CHAP. XXVIII The Chapter of History, containing foure score and eight Verses, written at Mecca. IN the Name of God, gracious and merciful. God is most pure, he understandeth all things, and is most wise. These mysteries are the mysteries of the Book that distinguisheth the truth from a lye. I relate to thee the history of Moses, and of Pharoah with truth, for the contentment of True-beleivers. Pharoah was powerfull on Earth, he entreated his Subjects as seemed good to him, he tormented ted one party, and murthered their Children, he abused their wives, and was of them that defiled the Earth. I gave my grace to the^ that were afflicted on earth I made them successors of Pharoahs Kingdom, I established them in his Dominions; I made Pharoah, Haman, and their Army to see what they most feared; we said, to the mother of Moses, give suck to thy Child; if thou fearest that they will mischief him, cast him upon Nile, fear not, neither afflict thy self, I will restore him to thee between thine arms, and place him in the number of Prophets. The domestiques of Pharoah found him upon the water, and saved him, to be one day their enemy, and to tormen^ them, because Pharoah, Haman* and their people were Infidels. Pharoahs wife said unto him, I entreat thee not to suffer this Infant to be slain, mine eyes rejoyce to see him, he shall one day be proffitable for our service as our Son, but they were ignorant of what should befall them; the heart of his mother was freed from fear, when she beheld him in the hands of Pharoah's wife, and scarce could she refrain to let them know that she was his mother; we caused her to have patience, and she had faith in our promises; She spa^e to his sister to follow him step by step, she followed afar off, without intimation that she was his sister, or that she regarded him. We had before prohibited Moses to suck the milk of any other nurse; then that of his mother; his sister  said to Pharoahs servant, wil ye that I provide you a nurse, and people that shall carefully nourish him? We caused him to be restored to his mother, to nurse him; she ceased from her sadness, when she knew, and saw that God was sincere in what he had promised, but the greatest part of the people know it not. When Moses was aged, about thirty three years, we gave him knowledge and wisdom; thus do I reward the righteous; Moses entring one day into the City, met two men that fought; the one was of the Children of Israel, and the other was an Egyptian, and of his enemies, whom he assaulted, and slew; after this he said, the Devil tempted me, he is the open enemy of men; Lord, I have offended thee, pardon me; he pardoned him, he is gracious and mercifull; Lord, since thou hast bin so gracious to me, I will never give aid or succour to Infidels. He continued in the City with fear, and kept himself upon his guard, on the mor^ow he again met him, whom the day before he had defended, who sought likewise ^ith another Egyptian, and required his assistance; Moses said unto him, thou art seditious; he replyed, oh Moses! wilt thou slay me, as thou didst slay him yesterday? Wilt thou be a murtherer of all men, or a just man? Not long after a man came [in hast] to him from the utmost part of the City, who said unto him, oh Moses! the Officers of Pharoah have conspired against thee, they desire to put thee to death; save thy self, and follow my councell: He departed from the City with fear, keeping himself upon his guard, beseeching his Lord to deliver him from the hands of Infidels; he went towards M^adian, and said, Lord suffer me not to folow an evil way, he met a great number of persons that made their flocks to drink, he with them found 2 maids that could not water their Cattel, he said unto them what do ye two here? VVe have not strength to draw water to give our beasts to drink, we tarry for the Shepheard, our father is too old to draw [it] He drew water out of the well to water their Cattell, and withdrew to a shade, because of the heat of the Sunne, saying Lord, I am deprived of all the graces which heretofore then didst confer on me, I ^m now poor and nec^ss^^^us. One of  those maidens came to seek him, and bashfully said unto him, my father calleth thee, to recompence thee for the pains thou hast taken in watering our catle; when he was in the old mans presence, he related what had befaln him. The old man said, fear nothing, I wil deliver thee from the hands of the wicked; one of his daughters said to her sister, give to this man to eat, and reward his pains, he assisted us with affection; their father said unto him, I wil marry thee to one of my two daughters, on condition, that thou wilt have a care of my flocks the space of eight years; ten years if it please thee, said Moses; I will not forsake thee, thou shalt find me an honest man, I wil serve thee the two terms, either 8. or 10. yeares, as shall seem good to thee, God is witnesse of what I say. After the term expired, Moses forsook the house of his father in law, withdrawing with his wife, he beheld affar off a great fire on the side of the mountain, and said to his Wife, tarry here, I see the fire of the omnipotent, I will speedily return, I will bring you a spark, peradventure you shall be warmed; when he drew near to this fire, they cryed unto him from the right side of the valley, from an eminent place, and from a bush O Moses! I am God, Lord of the Universe, cast thy staffe on the ground; when he beheld his staffe to move, as it had bin alive, he fled for fear, and returned no more: O Moses! draw near, and fear not, thou art in a place of safety, put t^ine hand into thy pocket, it shall come out white and shining, without harm; draw back thine arm into thy sleeve, it shall return to its former condition, thy staffe and thine hand shall be two signs of my Omnipotency to Pharoah and his Ministers, who disobey my Commandments, Moses said, Lord, I have s^ain an Egyptian, I am afraid they will take away my life, command Aaron who is eloquent, to go with me, to aid me, and to confirm what I shal say, I f^ar they wil traduce me: I wil give thee thy Brother for thy assistant, I wil give to you both strength to defend your selvs from their malice; go, do what is commanded you, ye shall be victorious, and all those that shal follow you: when Moses came to Pharoah, he made  him to see my miracles, and preached my Commandments to his Ministers; they said, this is bu^ magick and witchcraft, we have not heard these things to have bin spoken to our predecessors. Moses said, the Lord knoweth him that teacheth the right way, and him that ought to have part in Paradise, Infidels shall be most miserable. Pharoah said to his Ministers, do ye know any other God but me? O Haman! let me offer sacrifices, and build a Temple* shal I deceive myself with the God of Moses? I believe him to be in the number of lyars. He b^came proud on earth, with his Ministers, and they b^lieved that they should never be assembled before me to be judged; we surprized him with his people, and caused him to perish in the Sea; consider what is the end of unbelievers; we abandoned them, and they are in the number of the condemned to the fire of hell. They shall finde none to protect them ^t the day of Judgment; we cursed them on earth, and at the day of the Resurrection they shall be abominable to all the world. We taught Moses our Commandments, after the destruct^on of many Infidels before his coming. We gave him the Book, to be a light to the people, to conduct them into the right way, and acquire our grace, peradventure they will remember. Thou wert not with Moses when we spake to him; we created another age after him, thou didst not at that time dwell with the Inhabitants of Madian, neither didst thou ^each them our Commandments; it is we that have instructed thee in the History of past ages; thou wert not on the mountain when when spake to Moses; we sent thee through our special grace, to preach to men the torments of Hell; they have not yet had a preacher like unto thee, perhaps they will consider it; when they felt any punishment for their sins, they said, Lord, hadst thou se^t us an Apostl to instruct us, we should have obeyed thy commandments, and have believed in thy Law: and when on our part they were instructed in the truth, they said, doth Mahome^ work miracles like Moses? do they not traduce what Moses did, when they say, that Moses and Mahomet are two aparent Sorcerers? and when they said that they believed neither Prophet, nor Scripture? Say unto them bring any  book from God, that better teacheth the right way then the Old Testament, and more savingly then the Alcoran, I will follow it, if ye speak the truth: If they be not heard when they shall require this book, know, that they follow only their own appetites, and their impiety; who is more erroneous then he that followeth but his own passion, and is not guided of God? he guideth not Infidells; Certainly we have sent them the Alcoran, peradventur; they wil believe in it; they to whom we heretofore sent this book believe in the contents thereof; when they heare it read, they say we believe in those words, it is the very truth that proceedeth from God; we believe in the unity of his divine Majesty, they shall be doubly rewarded, because they have persevered in well-doing; they have overcome evill through their good deeds, and have expended in good works part of the wealth that we gave them. When they heard the faith evill spoken of, they withdrew themselves, took leave of the company, and said, ye shall answer for your and we for our actions. Regard not the ignorant, thou shalt not convert all them that thou shalt desire to convert; God converteth, and guideth into the right way whom he pleaseth, and knoweth such as serve him. They said, if I follow with thee the right way, I must forsake my Country. Shall not I establish them in a place of safety, where they shall find all sorts of fruits to enrich them? but the grea^est part of the people know it not. How many Cities have we destroyed that took pleasure in their evill life? No man inhabited them any more, except very few; and we became heirs of their riches. God shall not destroy Mecca, untill he have sent an Apostle to instruct the Inhabitants thereof in the right way; God destroyeth not a Ci^y, if the Inhabitants be not unjust, and disobey not his Commandments, The wealth of this world which ye p^ssesse, pleaseth you, but the riches of Heaven are much better, and eternall; will ye not understand it? Have we not kept promise with them to whom we promised Paradise? and with them to whom we promised the riches of this world, and in the end were in the number of the damned? Be thou mindfull of the day when  thy Lord shal cal them, and say unto them, where are your Idols, which ye beleived to be my Companions? the chief of them shal say, Lord, behold those that were seduced like us, we are innocent of their Idolatry, they adored not us, they shall speak that day to the Idolaters to invoke their Idols, but they shal not hear them, they shal be visibly chastiz^d on Earth: B^ thou mindfull of the day when thy Lord shall call them, and say unto them, wherefore have ye not beleived my Apostles and my Prophets? they shall be confounded, and rem^in dumbe. He that shall be converted, and do good works, shall be happy. Thy Lord createth what pleaseth him, and maketh choyce of what seemeth to him good. Praised be God, he hath no companion, he knoweth what is in the hearts of men, and what they make manifest; he is God, there is no God but he, praise is due to him in the beginning, and in the end, he commandeth over all things, and all people shall one day be assembled before him to be judged: Say unto them, Had God given a continuall night, even until the day of judgment, what other God is there that is able to you give light? will ye not hear me? had God given you a continual day until the day of Judgment, what other god could have given the night to refresh you? will ye not consider his benefits and his grace? he hath created the night for repose, and the day for labour, p^radventure ye will give him thanks. Be thou mindfull of the day, when thy Lord shall call the Infidels, and shall say unto them, where are the Idols that ye worshipped? We wil call a witness of every Nation, and will say to the Idolaters, bring your arguments that may prove the plurality of Gods; Ye shall this day know your blasphemies, and that there is but one God. Caron was of the people of Moses, he was proud, because of his riches; vve gave him so great treasures, that many men were burdened when they conveyed away the Keyes. Remember how his people said unto him, Rejoyce not above measure in thy great wealth, God abhorreth the that rejoyce without reason; Beg of him paradise, with thy riches forget not to do good in this world, give almes of the substance  which God hath given thee, be not disobedient to him on Earth, he abhorreth those that disobey him; these riches were given thee, because thou di^st instruct the people in the Old Testament; knowest thou not that God? destroyed in times past many rich and opul^nt persons? Who is more strong, more powerfull, more rich then God? He will not enquire of the wicked the number of their sinnes, he knoweth all, and the accompt. Caron one day went forth in publique, with all his retinue; They that affected the wealth of this world, said, Would to God we had as much wealth as Caron; he is happy! but the more knowing among them said, ye are unhappy, the grace of God is more advantageous to them that believe in his Law, and do good works, then all the treasures of Caron; none shall receive his grace but such as shall obey him, and persevere, in obedience to his Commandments. VVe deprived Caron of all his treasures, and none was able to protect him against us; then they that had coveted his riches, said, oh miracle! God giveth to, and depriveth of wealth whom to him seemeth good; Had not God given us his grace, we had bin necessitous; certainly the wicked shall be miserable; I will bestow Paradise on them that hate vanity and disorder on the Earth, and shall have my feare before their eyes; whosoever shall do good, shall find good who doth evill, shall be chastised after his demerits. He that hath taught thee the Alcoran, shall cause thee to return to the Mecca. See Gelaldin. place that thou desirest: Tell the Inhabitants of that place, that God knoweth them that teach the right way, and such as go astray. Thou didst not expect the Alcoran, it is a speciall grace of thy Lord; assist not the Infidels, and take heed least they seduce thee, after having learnt what hath bin taught thee; Preach to the people the unity of God, Be not in the number of them that belive many Deities, adore God alone, there is no God but h^; al things shal have end, except his face, he commandeth over every thing, and all men shall one day appear before him to be judged.    CHAP. XXIX. The Chapter of the Spider, containing sixty nine verses written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and merciful: I am God most wise. Men have beleived that it is sufficient to say we beleive in God, and that they be not proved: Certainly God proved their predecessors, and knew such as were zealous in his Law, and them that were Infidels. Do they who have done evill, think to escape the punishment of their crimes, and not to be judged? Such as hope to see God, shall behold him at the time appointed by his divine Majesty; he understandeth and knoweth all things. He that fighteth for the faith, fighteth for his soule; certainly God hath no need of men, their sins shall be pardoned who shall beleive in his divine Majesty, and shall do good works. We enjoyned the children of Israel to honour their father and mother, and to do good to them; if they press thee to worship many Gods, thou shalt be damned, if thou give ear to them, obey them not in this matter, ye shall be assembled before me, I will set before you all that ye have done, I will reward you according to your works, and place such as shall have observed my Law in the number of the blessed. There be men who affirm, that they beleive in God, and are impatient when evill befalleth them from God to prove them. If God give victory to the True beleivers, they say, that they are on their side, but doth not God know what is in their heart? he knoweth them that beleive in his Law, and those that are impious. The Infidels, said to the True-beleivers, do like us, follow our way, we will bear your sins; They will not bear them, they are lyars, they shal bear their own burthen; shal not an accompt of their sins be required of them at the day of Judgment? We sent Noah to instruct men, he lived upon the earth 900. and 50. years. The flood surprized, and destroyed the people of his time, because they  were unjust, and we saved Noah and those that were with him in the Ark; this ought to serve for example to all the world. Remember Abraham, who said to his people, adore one God, and fear him, ye shall do well, if ye have knowledge to comprehend it; ye worship but Idols, and are but lyars, those whom ye worship cannot benefit you; implore succor of God, worship him, and give him thanks for his graces, ye shall one day appear before him, if ye traduce me, those that were before you traduced the prophet^, Gods Messengers: Messengers are obliged only to discharge their message; are ye ignorant that God causeth men to dye, and shall raise them again? it is a thing easie to God: Walk through the earth, and consider how God hath extirpated your predecessors, and created after them another people, certainly he is omnipotent. He punisheth and pardoneth as he seeth goed, yo^ shall one day be assembled before him to be judged; you shall not render him impotent, either in the Earth, or in the heavens, ye shall find none of power to protect, or defend you against his divine Majesty; such as obey not his Commandments, who beleive not the resurrection, and despair of his mercy, shall suffer great torments; the people answered, kill Abraham, and burn him; but God delivered him from the fire that they had kindled, which shall serve for example to True-beleivers. He said unto them, ye adore only Idols, because of your love to the wealth of the world; ye shall despise and curse each other at the day of judgement. Hel shall be your habitatation and ye shall be deprived of protection. Lot beleived in his words, and said, I wil retyre ^o the place which my Lord shal appoint me* he alone is omnipotent and most wise. We gave to Abraham two sons, Isaac and Jacob: we caused Prophets to be borne of his race and t^ught his progeny the Scripture: we rewarded him in this world, and he shal be at the day of judgment in the number of the blessed. Rmember Lot, who said to his people, Ye defile your selvs with filthinesse unknown to any before you, ye incline to the love of men, ye rob upon the high ways, and defile on another. This people answered,  Let us see the Judgements of God, if what tho^ speakest be true. Then he said, Lord protect me against unbelievers. When our Messengers came towards Abraham, to declare to him that he should have children; they said unto him, We will ruine Lots City, and destroy all the inhabitants thereof, because they are impious. Abraham answered, Lot dwelleth in that City; they said, We know all that is within it, and we will preserve him, with all his family, except his wife, she shall be in the number of them that shall be punished. When our Messengers arrived at Lots house, he was troubled, in that he had not strength sufficient to defend them from the malice of the people; they said unto him, fear nothing, neither afflict thy selfe. We will preserve thee and all thy family, except thy wife; she shall abide among them that shall be destroyed; we wil cause t^e indignation of God to fall upon this City, because of their impiety; it shal serve for exampl to posterity We sent Chaib to his brethren, the inhabitants of Madian; he said unto them, Worship one God, fear the day of Judgment, and defile not the Earth. They impudently traduced him, but were surprized by an Ear^hquake, and rem^ined dead in their houses, as c^rkases. We destroyed Aad, and Temod, their ruine is yet apparent in the places of their habitations; the Devil tempted and seduced them from the right way, notwithstanding they knew their error. We destroyed Caron, Pharaoh, and Haman; Moses preached to them my Commandments; they contemned them, and became proud in the Earth, but escaped not the punishment of their crimes. We chastised some by an impetuous wind, and other were surprized by thunder; we deprived them of their riches, and they were drowned. God was not unjust towards them, they drew mischiefe on themselves through their impiety. They that worship Id^ls are like to the Spider; she buildeth her house of her cob-wed, that cannot defend from heat or cold. They would not adore Idols, did they understand what they do; God seeth what they worship, he is omnipotent and wise. I teach the people these parables, and none but the wise understand them. Truly God created heaven and earth,  it is a sign of his Omnipotency to True-beleivers. Instruct them in the Book that is inspired i^to thee; make thy prayers at the time appointed, prayers divert men from sin; to be mindful of God is the best work thou canst perform, he knoweth al the actions of men. Dispute with mildnesse against them that have knowledge of the written Law, except against the wicked that are among them. Say unto them, we beleive in what hath been taught you, and in what hath been taught us; Your God, and our God is one God; we are resigned to his divine will. We have sent thee the Alcoran, as we sent to them the old Testament: Such as understand the Old Testament, bleive in the Truth of the Alcoran. Thou hast not written it with thine own hand, hadst thou written it, thou hadst caused them to doubt, who desire to make it voyd: certainly it containeth, and teacheh Intelligibly the Commandments of the Law; none but infidels reject it. They have said, we will not beleive in this Book, unles God work in it some miracle. Say unto them, Miracles proceed from God, I am sent only to preach the torments of Hell. Is it not sufficient, that we have sent thee the Alcoran to instruct them? it containeth the effects of my mercy and precepts, necessary for their salvatio^. Say unto them, it suficeth that God is witnesse of mine actions, betwixt you and me; he knoweth whatsoever is in heaven; and in Earth: they that beleive in Idols, and have not faith in God, are damned. They urge thee to make them see the punishment of their crimes; if the time were come, they should soone feel it; they shall rescent it, when they least think of it, but they know it not; they shall presse thee to make them see it. Say unto them, Hell is prepared for Infidels. When they shall be plunged, in torments over their heads, and under their feet, it shall be said unto them, tast the punishment wch ye have deserved. O ye people that beleive! the earth is sufficiently large and spacious for you to separat your selvs from the wicked; worship me alone, al creatures shal die, and be assembled before me to be judged. The true beleivers that shal have don good works shall inhabit Paradise, wherin flow many rivers, wherin is the reward of the  righteous, of them that persevere to do good, and are patient in their affliction, and trust in their Lord. How many beasts be there that have not wherewith to live? God nourisheth them, and you also; he understandeth and knowet^ all things. If thou ask of the I^fidels, who created Heaven and Earth, the Sun, and the Moon? they will say, It is God. Wherefore then do they deny his Vnity? God en^icheth and impoverisheth whom pleaseth him he is omniscient. If thou demand of them, who causeth the rain to fall from Heaven, to give life to the Earth, after the death thereof? they will say, It is God. Say unto them, Praised be God, that ye avouch it; neverthelesse, the greatest part of men understand it not. The life o^ this world is but sport and vanity, life is in Paradise, ha^ they knowledge to comprehend it. When they enter into a ship, and see the tempest, they call upon God, and protest to profess his Law. And when he hath preserved them on the Land, they are imgrateful for his grace, and return to their Idolatry, they shall too late understand their error. Know they not that we have established in Mecca all safety and freedom? and that men are take^ away by violence to be slain, and made slaves? believe they in things unprofitable? shall they be ingratefull for for the graces of God? who is more impious then he that blasphemeth against God, and impugneth the known Truth? Is there no place in Hell for the wicked? I will guide into the right way them that shall fight for the Faith, God is with them that do good.   CHAP. XXX. The Chapter of the Grecians, containing sixty Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and merciful. I am the most wise God. The Grecians were vanquished upon the frontier of the Persians, but shall be victorious before the end of seven yeers. God disposeth all things from the beginning to the end; When they shall be victorious, the  True-beleivers shall rejoyce in the victory that God shall give them; he protecteth whom to him seemeth good; he is omnipotent and merciful. He hath promised them victory, and departeth not from his promises; of which the greatest part of men are ignorant; they affect the life of this world, and consider not their end: Will they not consider that God hath created the heavens and the earth, and all that is in them? and hath appointed to every thing a limited and prefixed time? Certainly the greatest part of the people believe not in the Resurrection: Will they not consider the end of their predecessors, who were more powerfull and wealthy then they? God hath sent to all an Apostle to teach them his Law, he hath don to them no injustice, they have drawn mischief on themselves through their iniquity; the end of the wicked shall be like to their works, they despise the Commandments of God, and deride them, but God shall cause them to die, and rise again, and all shall be assembled before him at the day of Judgement; that day shall they be desperate, their Idols shall not intercede for them, they shall forsake them, and they shall be separated from the true-believers. Such as believe in God, and do good works shall enjoy the delights of Paradise, and the wicked shall be chastised according to their demerits. Praise God, pray unto him evening and morning, praise is due to him in heaven and earth; pray unto him before the Sun set, and at the hour of noon* he maketh the dead to come out of the living, and the living out of the dead; he causeth the barren earth to revive, and grow green after its death; in like manner will he cause you to arise again, and come out of your sepulchers: it is a sign of his omnipotency, to have created you of earth* to have given you flesh and bones, and to have created the woman (of the rib of the man) to dwell with him; he hath commanded you to love mutually, and to exercise charity among you, these things are signs of his omnipotency to them that consider his graces. The creation of heaven and earth, the diversity of tongues, the differences of your visages, and of your colour, the night created for repose, and the day for travell, the lightning that terrifieth the people, and which through rain causeth the earth again  to flourish, are signs of his Omnipotency: It is a token of his Omnipotency to sustain the heaven, and the earth; ye shall come out of your sepulchres when he shall call you; whatsoever is in heaven and earth obey him; he causeth men to dye, and to rise again, he alone is God in heaven and earth, he is Omnipotent, and knoweth all things. He speaketh to you in a parable, drawn from your selves, your slaves; are they your companions? do they equally partake with you in the goods which God hath given you? How then will ye say that God hath a companion equall to him? Thus do I unfold his misteries to persons that have knowledg to comprehend them; c^rtainly the wicked have followed their apetites with ignorance; who shall guide him whom God shall cause to err? he shall find no protector; embrace the law of Salvation, God hath established it, that men may observe it; it admitteth no alteration, but the greatest part of the wo^ld are ignorant of it: Feare God, make your pra^ers at the time app^inted; be not like to them t^at say, God hath a companion; neither like to them that are at present in the number or Heretiques, and were before as ye are; every Sect is pleased in its opinions, when any evill b^falleth them that call upon God, and are converted: neverthelesse some of them return to their Idolatry; after the reception of his grace, they are ingratefull, they shall awhile be tolerated, and in the end they shall, too late understand their error: Have we taught them reasons and arguments, that prove that I have a companion? The peopl^ rejoyced when we enlarged to them our graces; and became desperate, when evill befell them; see they not that I give, and take away wealth, as to me seemeth good, This is a t^ken of my Vnity to such as obey my Commandments. Give to your neighbour what appertaineth to him, and particularly to the poor, and true beleivers, if ye desire to see the face of God; such as shall do it, shall be blessed. The money which ye put to Vsury encreaseth in the hands of men, God shal not suffer it to prosper; the almes which ye give shal make you to see the face of his divine Maj. and shall be doubly restored to you. God hath created you, he enricheth you, and causeth you, to die and rise again  can your Idols do as much? Praised be God, he hath no companion; disorder appeared in the e^rth, and in t^e sea, because of the iniquities of men; peradventure they will be converted, when they shall feel the punishment of their crimes: Say unto them, go throughout the earth, and consider the end of your predecessor, the greatest part of them were Idolaters; embrace the true Law before the day cometh, when none shall be heard; that day shall the wicked be separated from the good, the impious shall give an accompt of their impiety, and such as sha^l have lived well, shall enjoy the joyes of Paradise, the grace of God shall be their recompense, God abhorreth Infidels. It is a sign of his Omnipotency, to send the winds to bring you rain, and make you to taste the fruits of his grace; the ship runneth upon the water through his permission, for the advantage of your commerce; will ye not be thankfull to him for his benefits? We sent to every Nation Prophets and Apostles before thee, they came with most intelligible precepts, and with many miracles; we chastis^d those that slandred them, and protected the faithful. God sendeth the winds that elevate the clouds, and extendeth them in the aire in many pieces at his pleasure; he causeth the rain to fall where he listeth, and rejoyceth whom to him seemeth good of them that expect it with impatience; consider the effects of his bounty: he causeth the dry and barren earth to flourish again, and restoreth the dead to life, he i^ Omnipoten^. We sent the winds to assemble the clouds that covered men with their shaddow, nevertheless they are returned to their impiety; the dead shall not understand thee, neither likewise the dumbe, thou art not obliged to lead the blind, none shall hearken to thee but such as shall believe in my Law, and be obedient: Say unto them, God created you impotent, he hath given you strength, and after, having reduced you to the weakness of old age, doth what to him seemeth good; he knoweth mens secrets, and doth what pleaseth him; ^he wicked shal swear at the day of judgment, that they have remained but an hour in their sepulchers; they lye in like manner, when they deny the Resurrection; the true believers, that know the truth, shal say unto the^, ye  have remained there the time apointed in the book of God, to w^t, untill the day of Resurrection; behold the day of resurrection! ye knew not at what time it should arrive; this day excuses shall be unprofitable to Infidels, they shall be ^eprived of protection. We have taught in the Alcoran all that is profitable for the salvation of men; if thou teachest them my Commandments, unbeleivers will say, thou bringest nothing but disorder; thus God hardneth the hearts of the ignorant. Be patient, and persevere; what God promiseth is infallible; beware lest unbeleivers shake thy perseverance.   CHAP. XXXI. The Chapter of Locman, containing thirty four Verses written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and merciful: I am the most wise God.The Turks say, that Locman was a great Doctor in Davids time. These precepts are the precepts of the book filled with doctrine, it guideth into the way of salvation; the righteous who make their prayers at the time appointed, that pay tithes, and beleive in the day of Judgment, they are guided by their Lord, and shall be blessed. There be who deride this book, they ignorantly depa^t from the law of God, and have despised it, but shall one day be severely punished: when they are taught the comandments of God, they turn the back with disdain, they will not hear, and have ears stopped; Say unto them, you shall in the end suffer infinit pains: Such as beleive in the Law of God, and do good works, shal eternally enjoy the delights of Paradise; what God promiseth, is infallible, he is Omnipotent, and altogether wise, he created the heaven, and sustaineth it without a pillar, appearing to your eyes; he lifted up the mountains upon the ear^h, to fasten and hinder it to move; he hath thereon dispersed many beasts, and sent rain from Heaven, which causeth plants to spring forth, and herbs of divers sorts. Behold [here] what God hath created shew me what your Idols have created; assuredly idolaters are manifestly seduced from the right way. We inspired knowledg into Locman  and spake unto him to give God thanks; he that returneth thanks to God for his graces, doth good for his soul; God rejecteth the ingrateful, and praise is due to him in al places. Remember thou that Locman said unto his son, O my son! beleive not thou that God hath a companion, it is an exceeding great sin: we have commanded man to honour his father and mother; his mother beareth him with greif upon grief and weaneth him at the age of two years; be thou not ingrateful for Gods benefits, honor father and mother, thou shalt be one day before God to be Judged. If thy parents press thee to beleive that God hath companions, obey them not, follow the way of them that obey him, all men shall be one day assembled before him, to be rewarded according to their works. O my son! if thou dost evil, of the weight of a grain of Mustardseed, or of the weight of a rock, or of the greatnesse of heaven and earth; God wil know it, and put it in accompt, he is exact and omniscient. O my son! make thy prayers at the time appointed, do what is honest and civill, fly what is not approved, and be patient in thy adversities; regard not the world, disordred through pride; converse not with the proud, God detesteth the haughty; observe thy steps, walk with modesty, speak gently, they be persons that bray like Asses when they speak: seest thou not that God hath created for men all that is in heaven and earth, and conferreth on them his graces in generall, and particular. There be ignorant [persons] that dispute of the Diety without reason; when it is said unto them, do what God hath appointed, they answer, we will do what we saw don by our fathers. They consider not that the devill calleth them and their fathers to the pains of Hel* he that obeyeth God, and doth good works, fastneth him to the strongest knot, and will have a care of him at the hour of his end. The impiety of the wicked ought not to afflict thee, they shal be one day assembled in our presence, to be chastised; I will shew them all that they have don, I know what is in the hearts of men, I will prolong a while their punishment upon earth, and precipitate them in the other world, into the fire of hell. Hast thou not damanded of them who created heaven and earth? they said, it is God; say unto them,  therefore (...) be God; nevertheless the greatest part of them are ignorant. Whatsoever is in heaven and Earth is Gods, he hath no want of the world, praise is due unto him in all that he doth; if all the Trees of the world were Pens, and the Sea Ink, they could not comprehend the effect of his Omnipotency, he is Omnipotent, and knoweth all things. He created, and shall make you to rise again with one word, he understandeth and seeth all things. Consider they not that God causeth the night to enter into the day, and the day into the night: that he created the Sun and the Moon, that move in the heaven, until the day appointed, he knoweth whatsoever ye do, because he is truly God; they that invoke other then him, invoke things vain and unprofitable: God alone is most high, and most mighty: Seest thou not how the ship runneth upon the water, for a token of his Omnipotency, to such as acknowledg his graces? When the Wars arose against the Infidels, many called upon God, with resolution to follow his Law: when he saved them on the Land, some persevered to do well, and others returned to their impiety: none but deceivers and ingratfull [persons] despise his Commandments. O people! fear God, and the day when the father shall not be able to succour his child, neither the child serve his father, Gods promises are infallible; be not proud of your riches, neither that God tolerateth and suffereth you, he knoweth the time when ye shall be chastised, the hour that the rain shall fall upon the earth: he knoweth what is in the wombs of women, whether it be male or female: none but God knoweth what thou wilt ^o to morrow: none but he knoweth the place where thou shalt die; he knoweth all, he knoweth all    CHAP. XXXII. The Chapter of Worship, containing an hundred and thirty Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. I am the most wise God. D^ubtless this book was sent by the lord of the Vniverse, will the wicked say that thou hast invented it? On the contrary, it is the truth it self, which proceedeth from thy Lord, to preach to them that heretofore had none to instruct them; peradventure they will follow the right way. God created heaven and earth, and all that is between them, in six dayes, and sitteth on his Throne; who shall protect you? who shall hear your prayers but he? will you never consider it? He disposeth all things in heaven and earth, all men shall one day be assembled before him to be judged; a thousand years are but one day before his divine Majesty; he knoweth what is past, present, and future, he is omnipotent and merciful, he hath created every thing for his people, he formed man of the dirt, and dust of the earth, he inspired the soul into his body, he giveth you hearing, sight, and sense, but few men return him thanks for his graces; they say, what, shall we die, and return to be a new people? Certainly they beleive not in the Resurrection. Say unto them, the Angel of death shall cause you to dye, and ye shall return before God to be judged. Thou shalt then see how the Infidel will hang downe the head before their Lord, and say, Lord, we now see the certainty of the Resurrection; we this day know the truth of thy words, permit us to reurn into the world, we will be righteous, we now understand what is profitable and necessary for us, we could have given a guide to every person, my word is most true, I will fill hell with the wicked, and Paradise with the righteous; thus shal men be rewarded and chastised according to their works. Tast (o ye wicked!) the pains that ye have deserved, in refusing to beleive in this day wch ye have found; we leave you in the miseries du to your incredulity; tast the eternall torments that ye have merited through  your impiety. Such as believe in the mysteries of my Law are humble, they worship me alone, and praise me when they here mention of me; they are not proud, rebell not against my Commandments: they arise from their bed to make their prayers with fear and hope, and imploy in pious works some part of the wealth that we have given them. No man hath either seen or knoweth what God reserveth to recompence the righteous for their perseverance. The believers and unbelievers shall not be alike entreated; the believers that have don good works, shall enjoy Paradise, as the reward of their labours, and the unbelievers shall be precipita^ed into the fire of hell; the more they shall labour to get out, the further shall they enter into it; it shall be said to them, tast the pains of eternall flames, which ye would not believe. I will make the wicked to tast of the torments of the world, and the pains of hell, if they be not converted. Who is more unjust, then he that knoweth the Commandments of his Lord, and disobeyeth them? we will be avenged on his impiety: we gave a most true Book to Moses, to instruct the children of Israel; we put into the right way those among them that persevered in their faith, and obeyed our Commandments. Thy Lord shall judge the difficulties of the Infidels at the day of Judgment; see they not how much people we destroyed in times past, that reposed [confidence] in their houses? It is a token of our Omnipotency, will they never understand it? See they not how I thrust forth water in desert and barren lands? that I cause herbs to spring forth for the nourishment of men and beasts? will they never consider it? They demand, when will the day of Judgement come? Say unto them, that da^ shall not bring contentment to Infidels, and they shall be without protection. Depart thou far from them: perseveere, and attend they wait an occasion to mischief thee, but thou shalt see them chastised.    CHAP. XXXIII. The Chapter of Bands, and Troups of Souldiers, containing fourscore and seven Verses, written at Medina. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. Oh Prophet! fear God, and obey not unbelievers, God knoweth all things, and is most prudent in what he ordaineth; observe what thy Lord hath taught thee, he knoweth the actions of men; recommend thy selfe to God, it ought to suffice thee, that he protecteth thee. He hath not given two hearts unto men, he hath not enjoyned us to call your wives your mothers; those which you call your Children, are not all your Children, ye speak it only with the mouth, but God alwayes speaketh the truth, and guideth men into the way of salvation. Call your neighbour by the name of his father, this action shall be acceptable to God, provided, that ye have no evill desig^^^^ (...) the heart; is ye know not his name, call him your brothe^, (...) God, or Sir, God is gracious and mercifull. The Prophet is obeyed of them that believe in God, and honour his wives, as their Mothers. Kinsmen are heirs of each other, it is so appointed by his divine Majesty to the Believers that went out of Mecca to follow the Prophet: It is ordained in Scripture to do good to your parents. Remember thou that we received the promise of the Prophets of thee, of Noah, of Abraham, of Moses, and of Jesus the Sonne of Mary, (to worship but one God) we received a strong promise: An accompt shall be required of their actions, and the wicked shall feel the rigour of infinite paines. Oh ye that believe in God! remember his favour towards you; when ye were charged by troups of Enemies, he sent against them an impetuous winde, and troups invisible to your eyes, to fight them, he seeth all that ye do; those invisible troups came from the East, and from the West, from above, and below, when your sight was troubled, and your hearts failed you, because of the great number  of your Enemies; ye had already conceived a very bad opinion of the Law of God; then were the True-believes tried, they trembled with fear; The wicked, and such as were weak in their faith, said, that whatsoever God and his Prophet had promised them, was but abuse and vanity; Remember thou how a party of them said to the Inhabitants of the Territory of Medina, there is no safety for you with Mahomet, return into your houses: Remember thou how many among them required dismission, and said, that their houses were forsaken: Their houses were not forsaken, but they had a design to flye; had they returned to their houses, they had on all sides perswaded them to follow impiety, they should not there have made long abode, because the before had promised God not to fly; he would have required an accompt of their promises. Say unto them, flight shall be to you unprofitable, if ye fly death, for that ye ought no longer to continue in the world. Say unto them, who is able to protect you against GOD, when he shall resolve to destroy you? take none other protector but him; he knoweth them that were disswaded to go to the ^e^ell to spare their Wealth and Persons. They cast (...) upon thee, when they are surprized with fear, they turn their eyes into the head, as a man that dyeth, and when they are delivered from fear, they traduce thee, because of their extream avarice. Such men believe not in God, he rendreth all their works unfruitfull, it is a thing easie to his divine Majesty. The Troups of the Infidels believed they were invincible, and when they saw the troups of the True believers, they desired to flye. The Infidels desired to draw the Arabians to their party, and have intelligence to know in what condition you are; had they bin of your party, few of them had bin slain; the adhering to the Prophet of God serveth to you as a Cittadell, it serveth as a Bulwark to them that apprehend the day of Judgment, and think often on his divine Majesty. When the believers said, behold! what God and his Prophet promised us, they are sincere in their promises; the sight of their enemies encreased their faith, and zeale towards God and his Prophet. There be persons among  the True-believers who have performed what they promised to God; many of them are dead in obedience to the Commandments of his divine Majesty, others attend the same thing, and swarve not from w^at they have promised; God shall recompense them for their zeal, and chastise the Infidels, or pardon them if it so please him, he is gracious and merciful. God shall destroy the unbelievers with their wrath against the believers; he protecteth True-believers incombats, he is strong and omnipotent. The Iews descended from their Fortress, to give aid to the Infidels, but God cast fear into their hearts; a party of them were slain, and the rest taken slaves; they by their death made you heirs of their lands, their houses, their riches, and fortresses which you were not able to conquer; God is omnipotent. Oh Prophet! if thy wives be too ambitious of the wealth of the earth, and of garments too sumptuous; Call them, Say unto them, that thou wilt deal well with them, and wilt repudiate them wi^h mildnesse and civility. If they love God and his Prophet, if they are vertuous, his divine Majesty will give them an exceeding great reward: Oh ye wives of the Prophet! such of you as shall be unchaste, shall be punished doubtly more then other women, this is a thing easie to God; such among you as shall obey God and his Prophet, and shall do good works, shall be rewarded more then other women, an exceeding great reward is prepared for you. Oh ye wives of the Prophet! ye are not like other women of the world; fear God, and believe not in the discourse of such as have design to seduce you, speak with civility, abide in your houses; go not forth to make your beauty appear, and to make a shew, as did the ignorant of old; pray to God with affection, give almes, obey God and his Prophet, God will deliver you from his wrath, and will purifie you: be mindful of the ^aw that is taught you in your houses, he is mercifull to them that honour him, he knoweth all the actions of the Prophet, he hath promised his mercy, and an exceeding great reward to those (Men and Women) that shall obey his Commandments. Those men and women that believe in his unity, that resign themselves  to his divine pleasure, that are patient and humble, th^ speak the truth, that fast, give alms, and are chast; and (...) men and women that observe his law, ought not to coutr^ his actions, neither those of his Prophet, nor say, that th^ could do better the^ they, if they would endeavour [it.] (...) that disobeyeth God and his Prophet, erreth from the rig^^ way; Remember what thou didst say to him whom G^^ favoured,Mahomet was amorous of Zeid his slaves wife, he caused him to repudiate her to marry her, because of her beauty. to receive him into his Law, and whom th^ didst gratifie with liberty, that saidst, divorce not thy wi^^ and fear God; thou concealest in thy mind a design whi^^ God shal discover, thou fearest the people, but it is thy (...) to fear God alone. When Zeid did repudiat his wife, we ^^ryed thee to her, to the end their might remain no error ^mong the True-belelevers; when they shall repudiate th^ wives, they shal observe in repudiating them, what God ha^ ordained. The Prophet sins not in doing what God ha^ permitted; the law of God was in this maner observed by (...) predecessors, and the command of his divine Maj. is execu^^^ without delay. Such as preach the word of God, his Apost^^ and Prophets, fear none but his Divine Majesty, it suffice them that they are in his protection. Mahomet is not yo^ father,He is not the father of Zeid, to espouse the wife which he put away. he is the Apostle of God, and the last of all the Pr^phets, God knoweth all things, there shall not come an^ther Prophet after him. Oh ye that beleive in Go^! thi^ frequently on his divine Majesty, praise him morning an^ evening, he shall give you his mercy; the Angels implo^ pardon, that he may deliver from darkness; he is mercif^^ to true beleivers, the Angels shall salute them on his beha^^ at the day of Judgment,See Tefsianf Jo^hir he hath prepared for them an exceeding great reward. Oh Prophet! we have sent thee to be witnesse of th^ deportments of the People, and as a light to conduct them into the right way, proclaim to the True-beleivers tha^ they shall receive of thy Lord an exceeding great grace; obey not Infidels, nor the wicked, fear not their malice, and trust in God, thou oughtest to be satisfyed that God protecteth thee. O ye that beleive! it is not lawfull for you to abuse your Wives; if you repudiate them before ye have  ^nown them, deal well with them, and dismisse them with ^ildnesse and civility. O Prophet! we permit thee to know ^he women to whom thou hast given dowry, the women-^laves which God hath given thee; the daughters of thine Vncles, and of thine Aunts, that have abandoned with ^hee the company of the wicked; and the true beleiving wife that shall be given thee, if thou wilt marry her, and that she be not the wife of a true-beleiver. We know what w^ have commanded true beleivers, touching their wives and their slaves; we have instructed thee therein, to the end thou offend not God, he is gracious and merciful to such as obey him. Thou shalt retain whom of thy wives thou shalt desire to retain, and shalt repudiate such as thou shalt desire to repudiate, and shalt lye with them that shall please thee; it is better that thou repudiate, without offending God then to see them male contented, and sad; they shall be contented with the good that thou shalt do to them, in divorcing them; God knoweth what is in your hearts, he is Omniscient, and most merciful.Mahomet had nine wives. It is not lawfull for thee to know other women then thine own, it is not lawful for thee to exchange them, although the beaty of others please thee, except thy slaves;See Gelaldin. God regardeth all. O y^ ^hat beleive I enter not into the houses of the prophet withou^ permission, except at the hour of repast; and that by chance, and without design, if ye are invited, enter with freedome; when ye shall have taken your repast, depart out of the house, and tarry not to discourse one with another, this molesteth the Prophet, he is ashamed to bid you be gone, but God is not ashamed to tell you the truth. The wives of the prophet shal have the face coverd when ye speak shall unto them, this better resented of purity both in them and in you. You ought not to importune the Prophet of God, neither to know his wives; this would be a most enormous sin; if ye conceal any design, or discover it, know that God knoweth all. They shall not offend God in suffering themselvs to be seen of their fathers, their children, their brethren, their nephews, their maid servants, and their she-slaves, they shall fear God, he seeth all; God and the angels Bless th^ Prophet pray for the Prophet. O ye that beleive!See Gelaldin. pray  for the Prophet, and obey him: He that shall disple^ God and his Prophet, shall be accursed in this world, an^ shall feel rigorous pains in the other; such as do injur^ without reason, to those (men and women) that believe i^ God, commit an exceeding great sin. O Prophet! spea^ to thy wives, and thy daughters, and the wives of true-believers, that they cover themselves with vailes, they sha^^ be more honored, and shall receive no displeasure, God i^ gracious and mercifull. If the wicked, the whoremongers, and those of Medina, that are weak in their faith, quit no^ their impiety, I will give th^e absolute power over them* few among them will respect thee, but take thou them, and slay them wheresoever thou shalt meet them, God so commanded those that were before thee; thou shalt finde no alteration in the Law of God. The people will enquire of thee, when shall be the day of Iudgment? Say unto them, that God alone knoweth it, and that thou knowest not if it shall b^ very speedily; but that God hath prepared for Infidells an exceeding great fire, wherein they shall burn eternally, hey shall finde no protection, they shall be cast headlong into the fire, and shall say, would to God we had obeyed his divine Majesty, and the Prophet his Apostle; they shall say, Lord, we obeyed our Masters and Superiors, they seduced us from the right way; Lord, chastise them doubly, and give them thy curse: O ye that believe! be not like them that displeased Moses, he was innocent of the crimes that they laid upon him, he was inspired of God; fear God, and speak with civility, your works shall be acceptable to him, and he shall pardon your sins; He that shall obey God, and his Apostle, shall be happy; fidelity and obedience are pleasing to him in heaven and in earth* and upon the mountains. Such as depart far [from him] as did Adam, do injury to themselves, and are ignorant, he shall chastise those (men and women) that shall be disobedient and impious; he will give his grace to those (men and women) that shall believe in his Law, he is gracious and mercifull to them that obey him.    CHAP. XXXIV. The Chapter of Saba is a Province of Liemen. Saba, containing fifty four Verses, written at Mecca. IN the Name of God, gracious and merciful.See Gelaldin Praised be God, whatsoever is in heaven, and in the earth appertaineth to him, praise is due unto him, he is most wise and Omniscient: he knoweth whatsoever entreth into the earth, and cometh out of it, whatsoever ascendeth to heaven, and descendeth, he is gracious and mercifull to his creatures, the wicked demand if they shall see the day of judgment; Say unto them, yes, and that thy Lord knoweth the time; he knoweth what is past, present, and future, and all that is in heaven and in the earth, even to the weight of an Atome; what is yet lesse, and what is yet greater then an Atome, is written in a book that discovereth every thing; he shall reward the true-beleivers that have don good works; he shall give them his mercy, and enrich them with precious treasures: such as have endeavoured to suppresse his Law, shall feel the effects of his indignation. They that understand the Scripture, know that God hath taught thee the very truth, to guide the people into the right way, into the path of honour and vertue; but the wicked said among them, will ye beleive a man, who affirmeth, that after your death ye shall rise again, and be new creatures? he lyeth impudently, he is possessed of the devill. Certainly they that beleive not in the Resurrection, are in an exceeding great error, and shall suffer most greivous pains: see they not what is above, and what is below them? Consider they not the heaven and the earth? If I will, I can render it barren, and cause a peice of the heaven to fall upon them for a signe of my Omnipotency. We gave our grace to David, and spake to the mountains, birds, and mettals with him, to praise me; we commanded him to make cuirasses, and Iron was soft in his hand, as wax. O lineage of David I be not ingrateful, I see whatsoever ye do* we made the winds subject to Solomon, he commanded them evening and morning,  from the East to the West; we gave him a fountain, and brook of dissolved brass; the devils, through our permission, wrought it to his minde, and we punished in the fire o^ hell such as refused to obey him. They built for him lost palaces, and Depein pi^d. spacious houses; they formed basons fo^ water, chanels, and pools: we said unto him, O lineage o^ David! be not ingrateful for my graces, for that few persons do acknowledg [them,] When he dyed, through ou^ Commandment, nothing discovered his death to the devils, bu^ the wormes that had eaten the end of his staff^ whereon he leaned; when the devils saw him fall, they perceived, that had they known the future, and what was h^ from them, they should not have laboured so long a tim^ in his service. The Inhabitants of Saba have a mark of m^ Omnipotency in their Countrey, viz. two gardens, the one on the North side, and the other towards the South. (i^ was said unto them) eat of the good things that your Lord hath given you, and return him thanks; their Country is delicious, God hath been merciful towards, them, neverthelesse they are ingrateful and impious; we sent the river o^ Arem that overflowed their gardens; we changed them into two gardens of thorns of Cyprus, and a little An Judian Date. Tamarinde; thus did we punish them, because of their impiety. We established a way with many cities, for facility of commerce among them,See Gelaldin. and the City which we blessed, and spake unto the people to follow that way night and day with safety, and without fear: They said, God destroyeth us through the length of this way; they returned to their impiety, and we dispersed them upon the earth, to serve for example to posterity, and instruction to such as persevere in my Law, and acknowledg my graces. The devill caused them to believe his opinion, they followed him, except some of the true believers that were among them; he had no power over them, but to know them that believed in the Resurrection, and such as doubt. Thy Lord observeth and regardeth all. Say unto them, invoke your Idols, they have not power of the bigness of an Atome, neither in heaven, nor earth, God hath no companion, they shall find none to protect them at the day of Iudgment,  none shall intercede for them without the permission of his divine Majesty; if they receive any relaxation in their fear, they enquire of each other what God spake, and answer, that he spake the truth; that he is most high, and most mighty; Say unto them, who enricheth you with the good things of heaven and earth? they will say that it is God. Say unto them, who of you, or of us followeth the right way? Or who of you, or of us is seduced? Enquire not after our sins, we are not curious to know what ye do, God shall assemble us at the day of Judgment, and shall judge our differences with equity, he i^ an exceeding great Judge; say unto them, let us see the Idols that ye have worshiped; certainly there is but one God, omnipotent and wise. We have not sent thee but to declare to men the joyes of Paradise, and to preach to them the pains of hell, but the greatest part knoweth it not; they aske in what time they shall see the punishment that is preached to them; and if thou speakest the truth; say unto them, when the time thereof is come, ye shall not be able to retard, or advance an hour: they have said, that they will not beleive in the Alcoran, but thou shalt see them one day assembled in the presence of thy Lord, thou shalt see that they shall accuse one another; the poor^ shall say unto ^he rich, you have hindred us to obey the Commandments of God; they shall answer, have we seduced you from the way that was taught you? On the contrary, you were wicked and malicious: they shall say, on the contrary, you employed night and day your Artifices to render us ingratfull for the graces of God, and to induce us to believe that he hath companions equal to him; they shall repent of their sins, when they shall see their punishment; we will lay chains upon their necks, and they shall be chastised after their demerits. The chief Inhabitants of the Cities, said to the Prophets that we sent to them to preach the torments of hell, that they believe not their words. We have (said they) more riches, and more children then those that believe in their discourse, we shall not be damned, as they affirm; Say unto them, my Lord giveth and taketh away riches as seemeth good to him, but the greatest part of the people know it not; your wealth and your children  shall not give you accesse to God; such as shall performe good works, shall be rewarded, and shall live eternally in the delights of Paradise; they that s^all endeavour to suppress our Law, shall be cast headlong into the fire of Hell: Say unto them, my Lord giveth, and taketh away wealth as to him seemeth good; he maketh vain the alms which ye shall give, if ye observe not his Law; he is the rich of the rich: Be thou mindfull of the day, when I shall assemble the Idolaters, and shall say to the Angels, behold them, who have adored you; they shall say, praised be God, thou alone art our Master and protector; they adored not us, they worshipped the devill; the greatest part of them beleived in his word, this day they are not able to benefit, or hurt one another; they will say to the unjust, taste the torments of hell fire, which ye would not beleive. They said, when thou didst preach unto them our Commandments, this man would hinder us to worship the gods of our fathers, he is a blasphemer. They have said, that the Alcoran* is but Sorcery and Magick, and reade not the books that we have sent unto them. Their Predecessors did like them; they traduced our Apostles, and hindred them to preach the tenth part of what we had inspired into th^m, they traducd them but how were they chastised? say unto them, I preach to you to pray to God two by two, or alone, or in company; ye shall know one day, that your freind Mahomet is not possessed of the Devil, and that he preacheth to you the pains of hell; I require no reward of you for mine exhortations, God shall reward me, he seeth all. Say unto them, God teacheth his Prophets the truth, and what is to come; the truth appeared, and falshood was discovered, and the lyars were deprived of his mercy; if I wilfully go astray, or if I act what God hath enjoyned me, this shall be for my soul: God heareth, and is present at all things. Thou shalt see the Infidels filled with fear and affrighted when they shall come out of their sepulchre, they shall not escape the punishment of their incredulity; they shall then say, that they beleive in the Alcoran, but I will shew to them from farre the law which they have despised in the world; they shall be precipitated with their ignorance,  into a place remote from mercy and pardon: they shal be seperated from the true-believers, because they have doubted the Commandments of the Law of God.   CHAP. XXXV. The Chapter of the Creator, containing fourty and five Verses, written at Mecca.  This Chapter it intituled the Chapter of Angels, in the Book Tefsir and Ioahir, which treateth of the exposition of the Alcoran in Turkish.  IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. Praise be to God, Creator of Heaven and Earth, who created the Angels, the Messengers of his Commandments; they have wings, two, three, and foure; he maketh of his Creature what seemeth good to him, he is omnipotent; none can comprehend the grace that he hath given to his people, it is incomprehensible, he is omnipotent and most wise. Oh people! Remember the grace of God, is there a Creator beside him? he enricheth you with the riches of Heaven and Earth, there is no God beside him. How can the wicked blaspheme against his divine Majesty? If they traduce thee, certainly they traduced the Prophets that were sent before thee, they shall be one day assembled before God to be judged. Oh ye people! what God hath promised is infallible; glory not in the wealth of the Earth, beware least the Devill seduce you, and render you proud; because that God doth a while defer the punishment of your crimes. The Devill is your enemy, be ye his enemies, he leadeth them that follow him into the fire of Hell, where they shall suffer the rigors of infinite paines; their sinnes shall be remitted that believe in God, and do good works: Oftentimes, he that delighted in what he doth, believeth  he doth well; God misleadeth and guideth whom it pleaseth him; be not unwilling to depart from the wicked, God knoweth all their actions. He sendeth the winds that drive the clouds unto barren and dry places, to refresh the Earth, and cause it to revive after its death; in like manner will he raise again the dead. He that affecteth greatness, shall finde in God all manner of greatnesse; good speeches ascend even to his divine Majesty, and our good works are acceptable to him. Such as conspire against the Prophet, shall endure great torments, and their conspiracy become vain and unprofitable. God hath created you of dust and mire, be created* you men and women; the woman neither conceiveth, not bringeth forth, but through his permission; no man can either prolong or shorten his life, but following what is written in the book [kept in heaven] these things are easie to God. Those two Seas are not like to Eaphrates, whose water is sweet and pleasant to drinke; the water of the Sea is cold, and salt, neverthelesse ye eat of the fish of the one, and the other; Ye fish out of the Sea, gemmes, to adorne you; you see the Ship to run upon the waters, and cleave the waves, for the advantage of your commerce, peradventure you will return thanks to God for his graces. He causeth the night to enter into the day, and the day into the night; he created the Sunne and the Moon, that run in the Heaven till the day appointed. That God who created these things, is your Lord, the empire of the world is his; the Idols that ye worship have no more power then the skin of an Almand; if ye invoke them they shall not hear you, they shall deny you at the day of Iudgment, and are not of power to let you know either the joyes of Paradise, or the torments of Hell. Oh ye people! ye are poor and necessitous, ye have need of Gods assistance, and God hath no want of you; prayse is due to him in every place; he will destroy you, if it seeme good to him, and create another new people in your place; none shall bear the burthen of another, be it never so light or heavy, no, not when they are neer of Kin. Preach thou the torments of Hell to such as feare their Lord, without seeing him and make their prayers  at the time appointed. He that taketh heed of offending him, laboureth for himself; all the world shall be one day assembled before him to be judged; The blind are not like to such as see clear; darkness is not like to light, the shade and coolnesse are not like to the heat of the Sun; the living are not like the dead; God causeth himself to be understood of whom he pleaseth, thou canst not make the Commandments of God to be understood by them that are in their Sepulchers; we have sent only to preach the pains of Hell, and the joyes of Paradise, there is no place in the world where they have not been preached; If the Jnfidels traduce thee, their predecessors likewise traduced them whom we sent heretofore, to preach to them the mysteries of faith, and the scriptures; they were surprizd in their sins, were rigorously chastised. Seest thou not how thy Lord caused rain to fall from Heaven, to make the Earth produce many fruits of sundry sorts, and to nourish in the Mountains the Goats, the Stags, and Hinds? to nourish the Crowes and Ravens, the men, and beasts of divers kinds and forme? God gratifieth his creatures that acknowledge his benifits, he is omnipotent and mercifull. They who d^voutly read the book of God, who make their prayers at the time appointed, and bestow in pious works, secretly or publiquely, part of the wealth that we have given them, have hope of a recompence that shall never perish; God shall recompense and augment his Graces upon them, he is mercifull towards the good, and accepteth the acknowledgment of his graces. The Book that we have sent thee containeth the truth, it confirmeth the ancient Scriptures, GOD knoweth and seeth all things. We have given the understanding, of the Alcora^ to such as We have chosen among our creature; there be some who have ill discharged what we taught them; some have performed what was enjoyned them, and others have taught it with affection and diligence through Gods permission. This is a great grace, they shall enter into the garden of Eden, where they shall remain eternaly; they shall be adorned with collars of gold, enrichede with precious stones, the^  shall be cloathed with fine silk, and shall say, praised be God, who hath delivered us from affliction, he is most merciful, and accepteth the thanks of his creatures; such as through his speciall grace shall enjoy the house of eternity, shall be free from all pain, and the Infidels shall be cast headlong into the fire of Hell. They shall not dye in those torments, and their torture shall neve be asswaged; thus shall the wicked be chastised, they shall in vain implore succor of God, and say, Lord deliver us from these paines, we will do better then we have done heretofore I will no more prolong your life on Earth, I have sent you my prophets and Apostles, They preached unto you my Commandments, you would not hear them, taste now the pains of Hell, which ye have merited, the wicked shall this day be deprived of protection. Certainly God knoweth whatsoever is in Heaven and Earth, he knoweth all that is in the hearts of men He it is that hath made you to multiply on earth, impiety shall rise against the impious, it shall render them abominable before God, and put them into the number of the damned; Say unto them, have ye well considered the Idols that ye have worshipped? Tell me, what have they created on Earth? Were they Gods companions in the Creation of the Heavens? Hath God sent to them a Book, and reasons, to authorize their impiety? Certainly the wicked instruct one another only in pride and arrogancy; God sustaineth the Heavens and the Earth, he alone is able to sustain them, he is gracious and merciful. The wicked swore to fight for the encrease of the faith, if there should come to them a Preacher to instruct them; and when he came, they augmented their wickednes, became proud in the earth, and conspired against the True-deleivers; their conspiracy fell upon themselves, and they can expect none other things then what was ordained against their predecessors, the law of God admitteth none alteration. Consider they not what was the end of their Predecessors? who were more wealthy and powerfull then they? Nothing is impossible to God, he knoweth all things, and (...) omnipotent. Should God punish the people when they ^^nd him, he should leave no living creature on the earth,  deferreth the chastisement of the wicked untill the time appointed, when their time shall be come, he will punish them according to their demerits, he seeth all.   CHAP. XXXVI. The Chapter intituled, O Man, containing foure score and eight verses, written at Mecca.  Reader, the Mahometans have entituled this Chapter with two letters of the Arabique Alphabet, i, s. The Bedaoi saith, that i signifieth ia, that is to say o particul^ vocativa, and s, is an abreviation, that signifieth insan. [i e] Man, and that the Angel, speaking to Mahomet, began this Chapter in this manner, O man! I swear by the Alcoran, etc. See Tefsir, Kitab el tenoir.  IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. Oh man! I swear by the Alcoran, ful of Doctrine, that thou art a prophet, sent to teach the People the right way. This book was sent by the Omnipotent and mercifull; that thou mayst instruct men in that which was not taught their predecessors; Certainly, what was said is true, viz. That the greatest part of them is incredulous; we will put a chain upon their neck, and bind their hands to the very chin; they shall lift up the head to complain, but we will place before and behind them great obstacle, we will cover their sight with darknes, and they shall not see a jot. Misery is upon them; whether thou dost reprove, or not reprove them, they shall not be converted. If thou preachest to them that belive in the Alcoran, and to such as beleive in what they have seen, proclaim to them a generall pardon of their sinnes, and a very great reward. I make the dead to arise again, and write exactly in a book the good and the evil that men commi^. Relate to them th^ Parable of those of the City, whither thy Lord sen^  his Prophets; we sent into them two Prophets, they slandered both of them; we succored them by a third; they all three said to the Inhabitants of this City, we are sent from God to preach to you his Commandments. They answered, ye are but men like us, God hath not sent us a sign to make you known, ye are lyars. They said, certainly God knoweth that he sent us to you; we are obliged only to preach to you his Commandments; They answered, would ye make us Infidels like your selves? If ye end not this discourse, we will stone you, and make you to suffer heavy torments. They said, be your evill with you, who hath heretofore so ill instructed you? Certainly you are wick^d; Then a man came running from the utmost part of the City, who said unto them, oh people! obey the Apostles of God, obey them that require no reward from you for the pains which they take in teaching you, and who are in the right way. Wherefore shall not I worship him that created me, and before whom ye all shall be assembled to be judged? Will ye worship another beside him? If it be his will to chastise me, your Idols cannot save me, I should be extremely erroneous, should I believe in your God; hear and understnnd what I say unto you. [Neverthelesse they sl^w h^m] and said unto him, go, enter into Paradice; He said, in dying, would to God this people knew the graces that his divine Majesty hath conferred on me, he placed me in the number of the blessed; After his death we did not send Angels from Heaven to chastise the wicked; I will send them but once to destroy them; they shall one day be dumb, for shame that they have not followed the True believers, and of, being mocked by them that I sent to preach unto them my Commandments; Will they not consider how much people we have destroyed in times past, who are not returned, and that shall be one day assembled before me to be judged? The Earth, drie, dead, and barren, as a sign of my omnipotency for the wicked; we made it revive, and became green again, and to bring forth fruits, with wh^ch they were satiate; we there created Gardens, Date-trees, and Vines, we cau^ed Fountains to flow; they eat of the fruits  which are not the works of their hands; will they not acknowledg the works of their Lord? Praise is due to h^m that created the male and the female of all plants that the Earth produceth, who created man and woman, and many other things, of which they have no knowledg. It is a sign of my omnipotency, to seperate the day from the night, and to make the Sunne to run to his appointed place. We have appointed to the Moon her signes, she goeth and commeth alwayes through her old way; the Sun neither hasteneth, nor retardeth his course at any time, neither doth joyn himself by night to the Moon; the night cometh not untill the end of the day. And all, to wit, the Moon, the Sun, and the Stars exalt my glory in the Heaven: it is a mark of mine omnipotency, to have born their Fathers upon the waters in the Ark, and to have given them vessels like the Ark to bear them; had it pleased me, I had caused them to be drowned, without succor and salvation; I saved them through my special grace, until the time appointed. The wicked despise the signs of Gods omnipotency, and scoffed, when they were required to fear the wrath of his divine Majesty, present, and to come, and that their iniquities shall be forgiven them. When it was said unto them, give almes of the wealth that God hath given you, they answered, shall I give him to eat to whom God shall give bread when it shall please him? They are in a very great error. They will enquire of you when the day of Judgement shall be; and if ye beleive it, tel them that they must expect but one sole voice, that shall surprise them, they shall quarrell, they shall not be able to make their Testament, neither return to see their parents; in the end they shall go out of their Sepulche^^, and present themselves before God, when the Trumpet shall sound; Then shal they say, we are most miserable, to have departed from our graves, behold what God hath promised us! The Prophets spake to us the Truth, viz. That the world ought to expect but one voice; This day shall all men be assembled before their Lord, no injustice shall be done to any person, and every one shall be rewarded, and chastised after his works: Such as shall go  into Paradise, shall be in exceeding great repose, with al^ manner of contentment, they and their wives shall be safe from all evills, lying on delicious beds, they shall have all sorts of fruits, and whatsoever they shall desire, they shall be saluted on the behalf of the Lord, gracious and mercifull. God shall say to the wicked at the day of Judgment, Depart yee this day from the company of the good; did I not forbid you to worship the Devill, your open enemy, but to worship me alone, and that it was the right way? Did I not tell you that the Devill seduced a multitude of the people? Ye would not beleive it, behold Hell, that is prepared for you, through your incredulity. I will shut their mouth, their hand shall speak, and their feet shall be witnesses of their crimes; If we wil, we can make the Infidels blind, they shall find no way, they shall not be able to go or come, and shall be succored of none; had it been our pleasure we could have transformed them in their houses, and they had not been able to go forth; I will cast their head against the ground, and will render them infamous, whose life I shall prolong, and they shall not know their errors. We have not made them to understand the mysteries of the Alcoran, but that was not necessary; it is but to preach to the living, who comprehend what is spoken to them; it is most true, that the wicked shall be punished: See they not that we alone have created all the beasts of the earth, over which they command? We have made them subject to them; Some serve them to ride on, and others for their nourishment; will they be ingratfull? Neverthelesse they have worshipped Idols, they adored what could not deliver them from the pains of Hell. Afflict not thy selfe at their discourse. I know whatsoever they say, and all that they keep secret in their souls; Doth not man consider that we created him of dust? And that he is to arogant? God hath taught us how he formed his Creatures, neverthelesse the wicked have said, who is he that can give life to bones that are rotten? Say unto them, he it is that created you at first, and that knoweth what he created; he maketh fire to come out of the Greene Woods  which ye burn, and created the Heaven and the Earth; cannot he create other creatures like unto you? yes, without doubt, he createth what pleaseth him, he knoweth all things; when he willeth any thing, he saith, be thou, and it is; praised be he, to whome all things appertain, and before whom you all shall returne [to be judged.]   CHAP. XXXVII. The Chapter of Orders, containing fourescore Verses, written at Mecca. IN the Name of God, gracious and mercifull.See Kitab el tenoir. I swear by the orders of Angels that worship God, and attend his commands, by them that hinder men to obey the Devill, and by them that read and meditate on the Alcoran, that your God is one sole God, Lord of the Heaven, and the Earth, and of all that is between them, he is Lord of the West, and of the East. Wee adorned the Heaven and the Earth with Planets, and have kept them safe from the malice of the Devills; they cannot hear what is spoken in the Firmament, they are shamefully driven away on all sides, and shall be eternally tormented; if they heare any thing spoken, they heare it greedily, and follow [it] speedily, but the shining Planet persueth them, [and detecteth their malice.] The wicked have demanded if wee created any thing more illustrious then they; Certainely wee created them all of the dust of the Earth: Thou art amazed at their blasphemies, they deride thy amazement, and shall never be converted. When they shall see miracles, they shall scoffe, and say, that it is but evident magick to believe that they shall dye, and after, being earth, bones, and dust, they shall rise againe with their Fathers and predecessors: Say unto them, that they shall rise againe, and that they ere seduced from the right way; that the world shall be but once destroyed, and they shall see what will befall them at the day of Judgment: They shall that day say, they are wretched, and the Angel shall say unto them, behold the day of Judgment, behold the day that the Godly shall be separated  from the wicked; behold the day wch ye would not beleiv^* It shall be said to the Angels, gather them together, assemble their wives, and their Idolls, put them into the way of Hell, and stay them, to give accompt of their deportments, and why their Idols do not succour them. Certainly they shall desire to be in the number of them that have obeyed GGDS Commandments: they shall quarrel among them, and shall say, it is you that have seduced us from the right way, through your oaths; ye swore that ye followed the law of God, and observed his Commandments: they shall answer on the contraay, we have no power over you, you your selves were in manifest error, the word of God shall be accomplished against us, and we shall for company suffer the torments of hell; if we seduced you, we were likewise seduced, and we shall this day be your compaions in punishment. That day shall the wicked be in this manner afflicted: they become insolent on earth, when it is told them there is but one God, and say, shall we abandon our gods for a foolish and lying Poet? on the contrary, he teacheth you the truth, as did the Prophets that were before him; ye shall be chastised, and intreated according to your demerits. Such as shall obey Gods Commandments shall have a place of safety wherein to rest, with all sorts of fruits, in pleasant gardens, sitting orderly on delicious beds, with glasses full of drink, pleasing to the taste, which shall not make them drunk. Their wives white as fresh eggs, shall not cast an eye upon any but upon them; they shall talk together, and one among them shall say, I had on earth a companion, who asked me if I beleived in the Resurrection; and if after being reduced to earth, bones and dust, we shall rise again? come with me, let us go see what he doth; he shall see him in the bo^tom of hell, and shall say unto him, by God; it wanted little but that thou hadst seduced me, without the grace of God I had bin damned, as thou art we are not in the number of the dead, we shall not suffer any paine; on the contrary, we are in exceeding great happiness: thus are the righteous rewarded; who are the more happy? they who are in our felicity, or such as are neer to Zacon, the tree of hell? This tree commeth out  of the bottom of hell, it riseth high, and the branches themselves resemble the heads of devils; the damned shall eat of the fruit thereof, they shall drink boyling water, and hell shall be the place of their habitation; there Fathers were Infidels, they followed their footsteps, and the way of them that were seduced before them; we sent unto them Preachers, whom they refused to hear, but consider what is the end of the righteous, and that of the wicked. We saved No^h, and gave grace to such as obeyed him, we delivered him with his family from a great danger, and perpetuated his progeny; he shall be praised of all them that shall come after him, because we gave him our blessing; thus do I recompense the righteous, he was in the number of them that obeyed my Commandments; we saved him, and them that followed him, and drowned the infidels. Remember Abraham, God gave him an heart free from impiety and malice; he said to his father and his People, wherefore worship ye false gods instead of the true God? think ye to escape the punishment of your crimes? Then he had a vision in heaven, and said, I am sick of your Idolatry, they departed from him with purpose to be converted, and empty the Temples of Idols of their treasures; he said to the Idols, wherefore eat ye not the sacrifices that are before you? wherefore speak ye not? and gave them a great blow with his right hand: the people came together with wrath because he had stricken their gods; he said unto them, will ye worship the works of your hands? know ye not that it is God that created you? then they said among them, let us build a great pile, and put fire to it, and cast Abraham into the fire; they conspired against him, but we rendred them ashamed and confounded. Abraham said unto them, I go towards my Lord, he shall guide me into the way of salvation; Lord give me a son that may be in the number of the righteous; we declared to him that he should have a son, exceeding wise, when he arrived to years of discretion; he said unto him, my Sonne, I dreamed this night that I must sacrifice thee, what wilt thou that I doe? he replyed, my father, do what is commanded you, ye shall find me full of patience; when his father laid him on the ground, and put the knife nigh  unto his throat; we said u^to him, O Abraham! it is enough thou hast satisfyed thy dream; thus do I entreat the righteous, thus were we wont to prove them. We redeemed hi^ son with a fair Ram; he shal be praised of posterity, and tho^^ that shall come after him, shall bless his memory. Th^ do I reward the righteous, he was in the number of the^ that obey my Commandments. We declared to him that he should have a son, called Isaac; from whom should issue many believers, and unbeleivers. Certainly we gave our grace to Moses and Aaron; we delivered them with their followers from an evident peril, we protected them, and they were in the number of the victorious; we gave them the book full of light, and conducted them into the right way; they shall be praised in ages to come, and posterity shall bless their memory. Thus do I recompence the righteous, they were in the number of them that obeyed my Commandments: Elias is in the number of my Prophets and Apostles; he said unto the people, wherefore fear ye not God? wherefore worship ye the Idol Balan, and forsake the Creator of the world? God is your Lord, and the Lord of your predecessors; they traduced him and were condemned to the fire of hell, except such among them as obeyed my Commandments? We left his memory happy to posterity: thus I reward the righteous, he was in the number of them that obeyed my Commandments. Lot was in the number of my Prophets and Apostles: Remember thou, how we delivered him and his family from evident perill, except his wife, who remained among them that were chastised; having saved him, we destroyed the wicked; they saw in the mo^ning the foot steps of the ruine that befell them the night before; wil ye not understand this mirale? Jonas was in the number of the Prophets. Remember thou, that he fled in a ship, and was the cause of evill to the Saylors, he was swallowed of a Whale; ^ad he not repented of his fault, he should have continued in the belly of that fish until the day, of Iudgment; we cast him on the shore extreamly feeble we covered him with leaves of Filbert, and sent him to preach to more then an 100000 persons, that we reconverted, whose decease  ferred untill the time appointed. The Infidells have demanded if thy Lord hath daughters, as they have sons? did we create the Angels male and female in their presence? They lie, when they say, that God hath a son; hath he desired to have daughters rather than sons? how can you thus blaspheme? Consider ye not that he is God alone, without children? have ye any reason or authority to speak in this maner? bring your arguments, produce your reason, if ye are true. The Infidels have said, that the Angels were of the lineage of God, but the Angels well know that the Infidells shall be damned, because of their blasphemies. Praised be God, he hath neither son nor daughter, other then the righteous that worship him, and obey his Commandments. You, with your Idols cannot escape the punishment of your sins, ye shall be condemned to the fire of hell. There is none among the angels that knoweth not his place, and his order in Paradise, to praise and worship his divine Majesty. If the Infidels say, we observe the Religion of our predecessors, we are in the right way; Say unto them, that If they belive not in the Alcoran, they shall in fine know their incredulity. We have promised protection to beleivers, and Prophets, they shall be protected and victorious; depart for a time from the wicked, consider how God punisheth them, they shall feel the punishment of their impiety; wil they cast themselvs headlong into the torments of hell? assuredly they will be astonished when the shall feel them; depart from their company, and consider that they shall not be able to escape the punishment of their crimes. Praise thy Lord, the Lord of power and greatness, above the wicked; salvation be to the Prophets, and eternall praise to the God of the Vniverse.    CHAP. XXXVIII. The Chapter of Truth, containing fourscore and eight Verses, written at Mecca.  Reader, Mahomet intituled this Chapter with the Letter named in the Arabique Alphabet, Ssad, which signifieth in this place, Ssidk, that is to say, Truth. See the Gloss of Geladin, Kitab el tenoir. They have intituled it the Chapter of Truth.  IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. I swear by the Alcoran, that this Book teacheth the way of Salvation; neverthelesse, the Infidels resist the Faith, and are among themselves of a different opinion. How many have we destroyed in times past, that were like unto them? They cryed, and required succors, but they were no longer to be succored. The Infidels wonder, that a man like themselves should be sent to instruct them; they say, That he is a Magician, and a lyar, to preach one sole God. It is a strange thing! Their Doctors forsook their Assemblies, they went to preach through the City, and said, Persist to adore your Gods; we abjure the beliefe of the vnity of God, the last Sect did not preach it; it is an evident lie. Was Mahomet chosen among us to receive alone the Alcoran descended from Heaven? Certainly they doubt the Alcoran, they shall know the truth, when they shall be in the fire of Hell. Have they in their power the Treasures of the mercy of thy Lord, omnipotent and bountifull? Possesse they the Kingdom of the Heavens and Earth, and whatsoever is betwixt them? If it be so, let them ascend into Heaven with their forces; assuredly, they shall be shamefully beaten in all places. The wicked heretofore defamed Noah, A^d, Pharoah, the maker of Charmes, and Temod, the Inhabitants of the City of Lot; those that dwelt in the Forest, and their companions, traduced the Prophets, and were punished after their demerits; neverthelesse, the Infidels  consider not that they shall be chastised, when the trumpet shall sound at the day of Judgment, and that they shall no more return on earth to be converted. They say in scorn, Lord give us to see the Book of the Accompt of our sins, before the day of Judgment. Persevere, and be patient, be not troubled at their discourse, and call to mind our servant David, stout and zealous in my Law; the Mountains and the Birds praised me with him; they assembled in his presence, and obeyed him; we gave force to his reign, and endued him with knowled and eloquence. Hast thou learnt Davids quarrel, when they hindred him to enter into the Temple? and how he feared his Enemies? When they entred towards him, they said unto him, Be not afraid, we have a dispute among us, judge our difference with equity, and teach us the right way. This man is my Brother, he hath fourscore and nineteen sheep; I had but one, which he hath ravished from me, because he was stronger than I. David said, He hath done thee wrong, art thou troubled for one Ew? The greatest part of men arose against their neighbor, except such as believe in the Law of God, and observe his Commandments, which are few in number. Then David knew that we had tryed him, he implored pardon of his sin, he humbled himselfe, worshiped us, and was converted. We gave him pardon of his fault, we drew him near unto us, and lodged him in a place of content. I said unto him, O David! we have established thee on Earth, to determine the differences that shall arise among the people, follow not thine own appetite, it will seduce thee from the way of Salvation; such as shall erre from my Law, shall suffer grievous pains at the day of Iudgment. We have not in vain created the Heaven, and the Earth, as the wicked affirm; misery shall bef^l them, they shall be cast headlong, and burnt in the fire of Hell. Shall I alike entreat the believers, and unbelievers? the righteous and the wicked? This Book! We have sent it to thee, and blessed it, to the end the people may meditate the mysteries thereof; and the wise reap advantage for their salvation. We gave Solomon to our servant David, he was extreamly zealous in our service. Remember that  horses, ready and vigorous, were presented to him about evening; that he forgot to make his prayer at the houre of Vespers; and said, What? Have I preferred the love of the wealth of the Earth, to the remembrance of God, even untill the Sun set? He caused them to be led back againe, and sacrificed some of them (for expiation of his fault.) He caused their legs and neck to be cut off. We tryed Solomon, we caused a suppositious person to fit on his throne, and afterwards restored him to his dominions. He said, Lord, give me thy mercy, give me so happy a reigne, that the like hath not been seen; thou art liberall towards thy creatures. We made subject to him the winds, which blowed at his command, where it pleased him. We made the devills subject to him; some built his Palaces, others dived into the Seas, to bring him Pearls, and others were bound and chained to attend his commands; he retained and dismissed whom he listed, with rendring an accompt. We drew him neer unto us, and lodged him in a place of content. Remember our servant Job, that he prayed to his Lord, and sayd, That the Divell had heaped misery and affliction upon him. It was said unto him, Strike the earth with thy foot; thou shalt see water spring forth to wash thee, and to drink: We restored to him his children, and his riches, through our special grace, to be an example to posterity. It was said unto him, when his wife would have made him to murmur, Take rods in thy hand, strike thy wife, and swerve not from what thou hast promised. We found him patient and zealous in obedience to our Commandments. Remember our servant, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, affectionate and zealous in our Law; we saved, and chose them, among the righteous. Such as have my fear before their eyes, shall enjoy the delights of the Garden of Eden; where they shall repose upon most glorious beds; they shall there have all sorts of fruits, and delicious drinke; and their wives shall not look on any but on them. Behold, what is promised to them at the day of judgement, and these pleasures shall never end. The wic^ed and Infidels shall be precipitate ^ into the fire of Hell, they shall drink boiling water in abundance, and water extreamly full of all manner of noysom smells; they shall be precipitated  into the flames, and shall say to them that have obeyed them upon Earth, May ye be perpetually tormented, you have seduced and mis-led u^: On the contrary, may your selves be tormented, you have been the cause of our misery, Shall we not be able to see them whom we believed on Earth to be Infidels? and whom we de^ided? cannot our eyes see? Thus shall the damned quarrel. Say (to the people) I am sent only to preach unto you the Vnity of God, the Omnipotent Creator of Heaven and earth, and of all that is between them. Behold* the best Sermon that I can make unto you; neverthelesse you despise it. I know not what happened in Heaven when the Angels quarrelled. God hath inspi^ed it into me and I am ^ent but to instruct you, a^d to preach publikly the paines of Hell. Remember thou that God said to his Angels, I will create man of the mire of the Earth; when I have formed him, I will breath against him, and inspire my S^irit into his body; prostrate your selves before him with humili^y. The Angels there prostrated themselves, except the Devil; he was proud, and already in the number of the wicked. Thy Lord said unto him, wherefore dost thou not humble thy self before the work of my hands? Thou art in the number of the proud; he replied, I am better then man, thou hast made me of fire, and hast created him of the dust of the Earth. Then thy Lord said unto him, Get thee hence, thou shalt be chastised on all sides, and my curse be upon thee untill the day of Iudgment. He answered, Lord, defer my punishment untill the day of the Resurrection; he said, I will defer it untill the day appointed. He replied, through thy permission I will tempt all the world, except such as shall be zealous in thy Law, and shall obey thy Commandments. He said, I tell thee true, I tell thee true, I will fill Hell with thee, and those that shall follow thee. Say unto the people I require of you to recompence for my instructions, I am not importunate. Certainly this Book is sent only to instruct men, you shal one day know the truth of what it containeth.    CHAP. XXXIX The Chapter of Troups, containing seventy five Verses written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and merciful. This book was sent by God, the Omnipotent and wise. We sent it to thee, the contents thereof are most true: worship one God alone, and obey his Commandments; faith proceedeth from him alone: Such as worship any other but him, worship Idols. They have said, we would not invoke our Idolls, had they not power to draw us neer to God: Certainly God shall judge one day the difference that is between the beleivers, and unbeleivers; he guidet^ not him that is a lyar and impious. If he would have a son, he would make choise of one of his creatures, that should be pleasing to him praised be God, there is but one God, alwayes victorious, he created the heavens and the earth with proportion; he maketh the night to enter into the day; and the day into the night he created the Sun and the Moon, which performe their course in heaven, untill the day appointed, he is omnipotent and merciful: He hath created all of you of one sole man, of whom he created his wife; he hath given you clean beasts, male and female; he formed you in the wombs of your mothers, form upon from: he brought you out of three The obscurity of the mothers belly, her womb, and the skin that infol^ you in the womb. obscurities, he alone is your God, and your Lord, the kingdom of the world appertaineth to him, there is no God but he. How can the Infidel depart from his service? If ye will not worship him, he hath nothing to do with you, he desireth not that his creatures should be impious; his Will is, that they praise him; this is his pleasure, and none shall bear the burthen of his neighbour, ye al shall be assembled before him, he wil shew ye what you have done, he knoweth what is in the hearts of men: When man is touched with any affliction,See Gelaldin. he invoketh God, and turneth; and when he is in prosperity, he forgetteth his vows: he hath said that God hath a companion equall to him, and erreth  from the way of his law Say unto him, thou shalt be a while tollerated, in the end thou shalt be cast headlong into the fire of hell; and he that shall pray to God day and night, erect, prostrate, or on the knee, with fear of the torments of hell, shall enjoy the mercy of his divine Majesty. Are such as labour to be compared to them that are idle? They that have judgment will understand this discourse. Say unto them, oh ye people that beleive in your Lord! have his fear before your eyes; Such as shall do good works in this world shall enjoy abundantly the riches of the earth, God will innumerably reward them that persevere in obedience to his Commandments; Say unto them, I am commanded to worship one God, to professe his Vnity, and to be obedient to him. Say unto them, I apprehend the day of Iudgment, if I disobey God my Lord. Say unto them, I will worship but one God; worship ye others, whom ye will. Such as shall despise the Law of God, shal lose their souls, and families at the day of Iudgment. These are two great losses, and most certain they be involved in eternal fire. Thus God preacheth to true beleivers. O my creatures! speak unto them, that have my fear before their eyes, that they adore not idols, and that if they turn to their Lord, they shall enjoy the delights of Paradise. Proclaim to them that hear my Word, and obey my Commandments, that they are in the right way, and well advised; canst thou deliver from the fire of hell him that shall be condemned? Certainly such as obey God, shal enjoy the pleasures of Paradise, wherein flow many rivers, and there shal they dwel eternaly. This is the promise of God he swerveth not from that which he promiseth. Seest thou not that God sendeth raine from heaven, and maketh the rivers to run upon the earth, he causeth plants to spring forth, and herbs of divers colours; thou seest them become yellow; and then altogether drie; this is a sign of his omnipotency. Hath not he to whom GOD hath given the light of Faith, received a great grace from his divine Majesty? Misery is upon them, that have a heart hardned and forget his law, they are manifestly seduced; he hath sent an excellent book for the instruction of men, his precepts are alike in purity, and without contradiction: They that  fear God, tremble when they hear mention of this book, and finde their rest in the word of his divine Majesty. This book is the guide of the righteous, God by it guideth whom pleaseth him. He whom God shall seduce, shall finde none to guid him, he shall be precipitated into the fire of Hell at the day of Judgement; it shall be said that day to the wicked, tast the torments that ye have merited; their predecessors defamed the Prophets, and were punished when they least thought of it, God rendred them ign^mini^us in this world, and they shall feel in the other, tormen^s much more greivous, and they know it not. We have taught in this book what is necessary for the salvation of the people, peradventure they will learn it; it is in the Arabique tongue, without falshod and contradiction, perhaps the people will fly from impiety; God teacheth you a parable: Two men are associates in their traffique; the one is wicked, the other an honest man, are they alike? Praise is due to one sole God; the greatest part of the Infidels understand it not. Thou shalt die, all men shall die, and ye shall be assembled at the day of Iudgement, when ye shall dispute together; Who is more unjust, then he that blasphemeth against God, and against the known truth? Shall not the wicked be damned? Such as shall believe the Prophet, and fly impiety, shall obtaine from God what they desire; such is the recompence of the righteous, God shall pardon their sins, and reward them for their good works: doth not he protect his servant? They will terrifie thee wi^h the Idols which they adore; but he whom God shall mislead, shall finde none able to guide him, and none shall be able to seduce him whom he shall guide, is not he the omnipotent and revenging? If thou ask of the Infidels, who created heaven and earth? they will say it is God; Say unto them, have ye therefore considered the Idols which ye adore, can they exempt you from the wrath of God, when it shall be his pleasure to chastise you? Shall they be able to hinder his grace, when it shall be his will to pardon you? Say unto them, my refuge is God, I am resigned to his Will, the wise trust in his divine Majesty. Say unto them, oh people! do as you understand him,  I will do as I understand him; ye shall know in the end, that whosoever shall be condemned shall be ashamed, and be precipitated into eternall torments, We have sent unto thee the most true book, to instruct the people; He that shal follow the right way, shal meet with nothing but good; and he that shall go astray, shall meet with nothing but evill; thou art not the guardian of the wicked; God causeth men to dye when the hour of their death is arrived; he deferreth the death of many during their sleep, and remitteth that of others to the time appointed, this is a sign of his omnipotency, to such as consider it, Will ye worship any but God? Say unto them; how shall your Idols be able to intercede for you, since they want power? know you not this? Say unto them, we ought to invoke one God alone, King of the heaven and earth; you all shall one day assemble before him to be judged. The Infidels tremble with fear, whe^ they hear mention of one sole God, and rejoyce when they hear speak of their Idols; Say unto them, God is Creator of the heavens and the earth, he knoweth the past, present, and future; (Lord!) thou shalt one day judge the differences of thy creatures: Should the Infidels possess al the riches of the earth, and yet as much more, they would not be able to escape the fire of Hel at the day of Iudgment; they shall be punished more greivously then they imagine, their sins shall be set before them, and they shall feel the rigors of the torments which they despise: man calleth upon us, when he is in affliction, and we give him our grace, he saith, he meriteth it: on the contrary, this is to prove him, but most of them are ignorant of it; their predecessors spake as they; the good that they have done, hath profitted them nothing; and the misery that they have merited, is faln upon them, they shall not escape the punishment of their crimes. Know they not that God giveth and taketh away wealth from whom pleaseth him? This is a signs of his omnipotency for the righteous. Say unto them, oh people! they who have off^nded God, ought not to despair of his grace, he is gracious and mercifull; be ye Converted, and recommend your selves to his will before ye be condemned, otherwise ye shall remain without protection;  follow the instruction that God hath sent to you, before ye be chastised, the punishment of your crimes shall surprise you, ye know not the time; the wicked shall be afflicted, for that they have not obeyed Gods Commandments, they shall know their damnation, and the sin that they have committed, in scorning the trve-believers: They shall say, had God guided me into the right-way, I had had his fear before my eyes. When they shall see hell, they shal say, could I return into the world, I would be in the number of the righteous; on the contrary, my Commandments were taught you, but ye became proud, and dispised them. Thou shalt s^e that day how the visages of Infidels shall be blackned: Is there not a place in hell prepared for the proud? God loveth, and putteth into a place of felicity them that fear him, they shall not be touched, either with displeasure or affliction; God hath created all things and disposeth all at his pleasure; he hath in his power the keyes of heaven and earth, such as disobey him are damned. Say unto them, oh ignorant [men] will ye enjoyn me to worship another god, besides God? It hath been preached to you, and your predecessors, that all your good works shall be unprofitable, if ye adore many gods, and that you shall be in the number of the damned: there is but one God, worship him, and be mindfull of his graces. The Infidels have not praised God as he ought to be praised, they have no knowledge of his power, he shall make earth to tremble, and gather together the heavens by the strength of his right hand at the day of Iudgment; praised be God, he hath no companion. When the Trumpet shall sound the first time, he shal cause to dis, whom he will have to die in the heavens and earth; the second time all the world shall rise again, and attend his commandments; the earth shall be full of the light of the Lord thereof, he shall bring his book, where in shal be written what the Prophets and Martyrs have taught, he shal judg the world with equity, and shall not do injustice to any; every one shal be rewarded and chastised for his works, he knoweth all that they have don he shal send the Infidels into the fire of hel, in troops; ^hen they shal be arrived at the gate, it shal open before  their eyes; it shall be said unto them, behold Hell, which ye have merited; were there not Prophets and Apostles, to teach you the Commandments of God, and to preach unto you on Earth the coming of this rigorous day? They shall say, yes, but the word of God shall be accomplished against the wicked. It shall be said unto them, goe, enter into Hell, ye shall abide there eternally, it is the habitation of the proud. Such as shall have the fear of God before their eyes, shall be conducted in troups to the gate of Paradise, the gate shall open before their eyes; it shall be said unto them, behold what ye have gained, the peace of God is with you, ye have not been ignorant, enter into Paradise, ye shall dwel therein eternally. They shall say, praised be God, for that we believed in his Law; and because we are heirs of his grace, we will goe into Paradise, into what place shall seeme good to us, God giveth his blessing to the righteous. Thou shalt see the Angels about the throne of thy Lord, who shall praise and exalt his glory; they shall say, God hath judged his creatures with equity, praise is due to the Lord of the Vniverse.   CHAP. XL. The Chapter of the True-believer, containing eighty five Verses, written at Mecca.  Reader, Gelaldin entituleth this Chapter, Of the Pitifull.  IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. God is prudent and wise. This Book is sent by the omnipotent, who knoweth all things, who pardoneth sinnes, and accepteth the conversion of his Creatures, he is severe in his chastisements, and indulgent to his people, there is no God but he, and all the world shall one day be assembled before his divine Majesty [to be judged.] No man disputeth against the precepts of the Alcoran, but the wicked; be not thou discontented if they live on earth with some felicity; the people of Noahs time contemned his instructions,  their posterity did like them, and every Nation hath conspired the death of them whom God sent to instruct them; thy disputed to obscure the truth through their lies, but they were punished; and after what manner? So is the word of God accomplished against the wicked, they all shall be damned. The Angells that are about the Throne of God, and those that bear him, praise and exalt his divine Majesty, they beleive in his unity, and beg pardon of him for the True-believers; Lord, Lord, thy mercy extendeth through the whole world nothing is hid from thee, either in Heaven or Earth, pardon their sins that convert, and embrace thy holy Law, deliver them from the fire of Hell, open to them the gate of the gardens of Eden, which thou hast prepared for them their Fathers, wives, and children, and them of their lineage that shal do good works thou art omnipotent and wise Depart from sin, he that shall depart [from it] shall resent the effects of Gods mercy at the day of Iudgment, and shall enjoy eternall felicity; the Infidels shall be hated of God, his hatred is far more dangerous then yours; wil ye be Indels after being called to the observation of the Law of Salvation? They said, Lord, wilt thou cause us to dye twice and shall we twice rise againe? But they shall say at the the day of Judgment, Lord, we confesse we have offended thee, we acknowledge our sinne, in having renounced the belief of thine unity; Shall we never go out of Hell, to observe thy Law, and follow the way of salvation? No, ye shal suffer in the fire of Hell, because that ye have believd them that adored Idols, and because ye have said, that God hath companions equall to him. All things obey one sole God omnipotent, he it is that made you to see his Miracles, and sendeth you the riches of Heaven and Earth; none consider it but such as are converted. Pray to God, and observe his LAW, although it be against the will of the wicked; he elevateth his Creatures to what degree he listeth, he hath created his Throne, and sent his inspirations to whom he seeth good, to preach the day of Judgement; that day shall the people come out of their Monuments, and none shal be able  to hide himselfe from his divine Majesty. Who shall command that day? It shall be God alone, victorious; that day shall he recompense every one after his works, without injustice, he is exact to make accompt. If thou preach to the wicked the day of Judgement, their heart will lift them up, and they shall be full of affliction, their prayers shall not be heard, and none shall intereede for them: God knoweth them that have eyes of treachery, and seeth all that is in the hearts of men, he judgeth of every thing with truth; the Idols which they worship are without power, God alone understandeth all things, and is omnipotent. Consider they not what was the end of their predecessors? who were more powerfull, and more wealthy then they? God surprized them in their sinnes, there was none of power to save them, for that they despised the Prophets of his divine Majesty, they contemned his Law, and were impious, but he severely chastised them, he is omnipotent, and most severe. Wee sent Moses with miracles, with reasons cleare and intelligible to Pharoah, to Haman, and Caron; they said that Moses was A Sorcerer, and a Lyar; and when hee preached to them the truth on our behalfe, they said, kill him, with all those that believe him, and make their wives infamous; but their conspiracy was but impiety: Pharoah said, hinder me not to kill Moses, let him invoke his God to save him, I fear that he may alter your Law, and introduce some disorder in the Land; Moses said, God, mine and your Lord, shall defend me from the malice of the proud, that believe not the day of judgement: Then a man of the domestiques of Pharoah, that secretly professe the true Law, said, will ye slay a man that declareth that God is his Lord? and that hath made you to see miracles? if he be a lyar, his lye shal be against him, but if he speak the truth, something of what he hath preached shall befal you, God guideth nether the wicked nor lyars. Oh people! you this day command on Ear^h with splendor, who shall defend us from the wrath of God, if it fall upon us? Pharoah said, I speak nothing to you, but what I have told you heretofore, and I will guid you all into the right way, He of his Domestiques, that secretly professed  the true Law, said, oh people! I fear lest ye be chastise as have been your predecessors, as were the people of No^^* Aad, Temod, and those that were after them; God will (...) do injustice to men, I fear for you the day of judgment, a da^ when ye shall rise again with terror, to render accompt ^ your actions, he whom God shal seduce shall find none (...) guide him. Certainly Joseph came hertofore with instructions, clear and intelligible: nevertheless ye doubted, even untill his death, and said, that after him God shall not send^ Prophet like unto him, thus doth GOD seduce the wicked, that doubt of his Law; he hateth such as dispute without reason, they are abhorred of them that believe in his divine Majesty; Thus God hardneth the heart of the proud, and tyrants. Pharoah sayd to Haman was Pharoahs Leiutenant General. Haman, build me an high Palace, peradventure I shal arrive at the Heavens, and as high as the God of Moses, I beleive him to be a lyar. Thus Pharaoh delighted in his wicked actions, he erred from the right way, and his conspiracy was but his destruction, He of his family that was a True-beleiver, said, oh people! follow me,See Gelaldin. I will guide you into the right way, the riches of the earth pass away lightly, and the riches of Heaven are eternall; he that doth evill shall finde evill; who doth good, man or woman, beleiving in God, shall enter into Paradise, where he shall be enriched innumerably, with all manner of riches* Wherefore invite you me to precipitate my self into the fire of Hell, since I exhort you to salvation? Ye invite me to be wicked, and to beleive that God hath companions, and I know it is not so; I call you to the omnipotent and mercifull [God,] doubtlesse I will not worship your Idols, they cannot hear you, either in this world, or in the other; we all shall be one day assembled before God, who will condemn Infidels to the fire of Hell; consider hereafter what to you I have preached: I am resined to the will of God* he beholdeth all the actions of his creatures, he shall chastise them for the evill that they shall commit, and for their wicked designes. He sent his punishment upon the Lineage of PHAROAH, they deserved to be precipitated into the fire of Hell, they shall burn evening and morning. It shall be said to  ^hem at the day of Iudgment, oh people of Pharoah! goe, enter into the fire of Hell. The Infidels shal quarrell in Hell, the poor shall say unto the rich; We followed you, are you able this day to deliver us from eternal flames? they shall answer, we all are damned with you, God is a most just Iudge. The damned shall say to the Ministers of Hell, Pray to your Lord, that he may asswage these torments for one day; they shall answer, had ye not on earth the Prophets and Apostles of God to instruct you? They shall say yes; pray therefore to God your selves; the wicked love nothing but impiety; I will protect on earth my Prophets, and them that observe my Law, and particularly at the day of judgment; that day the wicked shall have no excuse that shal advantage them, my curse shall fall upon them, and they all shall be damned. We taught Moses the way of Salvation, and made the Children of Israel heirs of his instructions, to instruct them that shal understand them. Persevere and be patient, the promise of God is infallible; implore pardon of thy sinnes, and exalt the praise of thy Lord evening and morning. They that dispute against the Commandments of God are without reason, and have nought in their souls but pride and ignorace: Implore succor of God, he understandeth and seeth all things, the Creation of the Heavens, and of the Earth, is greater then the Creation of men, but the greatest part of men know it not; the blind is not like to him that seeth clearly; he that doth good; is not like to him that doth evill, neither is obscurity such as the light, but few men consider it. Doubtlesse the day of Iudgment shall come, neverthelesse the greatest part of men will not believe it: Your Lord hath said, call upon me, I will heare you; Such as shall resist my Law, shall go into Hell, and be eternally seduced. God hath created the night for repose, and the day for travell, he is bountiful towards his Creatures, bvt the greatest part of the peopple are ingratefull, GOD is your LORD, Creator of all things, there is no GOD but he. How can the wicked blaspheme? So do they blaspheme that are ingrateful for the graces of GOD; he hath established you on Earth, he hath covered you  with the Heavens, he hath formed you, enriched you; he your God, your Lord, blessed be God, Lord of the V^^ verse, he it is that giveth and depriveth you of life, there no God but he, be obedient to him, and observe his La^ Praised be God, Lord of the Vniverse, who hath create^ you of mire. Say unto the Infidels, I am forbidden to wo^ship the Idols that ye adore; God hath taught me his ^nity, I have received command to worship none but the Lord of the Vniverse; he created you of dust, mire, and co^gealed blood, he causeth you to be born little Infants, h^ maketh you to arrive to the age of discretion, to virility, and old age; many dye before that age, and all attaine to the time of their destiny, peradventure ye shall understand his unity; he it is that maketh you to live and to dye, and when he willeth any thing, he saith, be thou, and it is. See ye no^, that they that dispute against his Commandments, depar^ from his Law? Such as reject our Commandments, and what we enjoyed our Prophets to preach to men, shall find their errors, when they shall see chaines on their necks, and fetters on their feet; they shall be dragged and burned in Hell; then shall it be said unto them, where are those Idols that yee adored upon Earth? they shall answer, they are departed from us, certainly they are without power; thus God seduceth Infidels, to their confusion. It shall be said unto them, these paines befall you, for that ye were proud and insolent without reason; enter within the gates of Hell, which is the habitation of the proud, ye shall dwell there eternally. Be patient and persevere, the word of God is infallible; I will make thee to see a part of what I have promised to men, I will cause thee to dye, and thou shalt behold them all assembled to be judged. Certa^nly we sent Prophets before thee, we have spoken to thee of one part of our, Apostles, and the rest are concealed from thee; neither Prophets nor Apostle can preach any thing without Gods permission; he chastiseth the wicked when he pleaseth, he shall judge the differences that are between them and the Prophets, and shall destroy the unbelievers. God hath created the beasts for your use; Some ye eat and others serve you to ride on, [from them] ye reap  profit, they bear the burden, as likewise do the ships for the advantage of your commerce; God manifesteth to you his graces: And what graces! Will ye despise them? Do not unbelievers consider the end of those that were before them, who were more powerfull and rich then they? their treasures did not save them, they derided the Peophets and Apostles that preached to them; and in the end felt the paines that they had despised. When they shall fear the torments of hel, they shall say, We believe in one God alone, and renounce Ido^s. This profession of Faith shal be unprofitable to them in Hell; they shall incur the rigour of the Law of God, that was observed against their predecessors, and all unbeleivers shall be damned.   CHAP. XLI. The Chapter of Exposition, containing fifty and foure Verses written at Mecca.  Reader, Gelaldin intituleth this Chapter, Of Adoration,  IN the name of God, gracious and merciful. The Alcoran was sent by the gracious and merciful God: It explaineth divine Mysteries in the Arabique tongue, to them that have knowledge to understand them; it proclaimeth to the good, the delights of Paradise, and preacheth to the wicked the torments of Hel; neverthelesse, the greatest part of the world pepart from the Faith, and hear not thy words: They say, We have obdurate hearts, we cannot comprehend what thou preachest, our ears are stopped, we are too remote to heare what thou sayest. Observe thy Law, we will live after our own. Say unto them, I am a man like you, your God is one sole God, be obedient to him, and begge pardon of him for your sins: Misery is upon unbelievers, that pay not Tiths, and believe not in the day of judgment. The believers that shall do good works,  shall enjoy an infinite reward. Say unto them, How, wil^ ye be wicked towards him that created the Earth in tw^ days?Munday and Tuesday. how can you say that he hath a Companion equa^ to him? He is sole Lord of the Vniverse; he raised the Mountains, blessed the Earth, and gave to every Regio^ the particulars thereof in four days, for them that shall have need:See Gelaldin. After this he ascended into Heaven, that was like unto smoke, and said unto Heaven and Earth, Ye shall obe^ me, either through force or affection: They answered, Lord, we will be obedient to thy Commandments. He created seven Heavens in two days,Thursday and Friday. and disposed every Heaven after his own will; he adorned them with Stars, and preserveth them from the malice of the Devil.See Gelaldin. This is a^ effect of his Omnipotency; he is omnipotent, and knoweth all things. If the unbelievers depart from the Faith, say unto them, I have threatned you, as heretofore thunde^ did the people of Aad and Temod, when the Prophets taugh^ them the Law of the ancient True believers, to wit, To worship but one God; They said, Were it Gods pleasure to alter our Law, he would have sent us Angels to preach unto us; we will not believe in thy mission. The people of Aad waxed proud on the Earth without reason, and said, Who is more powerfull then we? will they not consider, that he that created them, is more powerful and wealthy then they? Neverthelesse they despised our Commadments. We sent against them a cold and impetuous wind, in an unhappy time, that made them to suffer on Earth shame and ignominy, because of their crimes: He shall cause them to feel the pains of Hell, that are much greater then those of the Earth, and they shall be eternally deprived of protection. We instructed the men of Temod in the right way; they preferred blindnesse to light, and impiety to Salvation; they were surprized by thunder, and suffered great afflictions, because of their sins. We saved none of them, but the believers, who had our fears before their eyes. Be thou mindfull of the day that the Enemies of God shall be assembled in Hell; they shall defend their cause before the Judge, until testimony be brought against them; their ears, their eyes, and their skin shall be witnesses  of their iniquities: They shall say, Wherefore do ye witnesse against us? They shall answer, He that made us to speak, giveth speech to every thing; he it is that created you, and ye are this day assembled before him to be judged. Ye did not well conceal your selves, when ye offended him; your ears, your eyes, your skin are witnesses against you; ye beleived that God should not see your sins, this was your opinion: Certainly he shall chastise you and you all shall be in the number of the damne^. Persevere, and be thou patient, the fire of Hell shall be the^r habitation; they shall not be able to please God in the flames. We have given them the Devils, for their Companio^s, who caused them to delight in sin. The word of God shal be accomplished against them, as it was accomplished against their predecessors; as well men as Devils, that are condemned. The unbelievers have said, Heare not that Alcoran, it is full of error; peradventure ye shall be seduced. I will cause them to suffer grievous pains, and will chastise them after their demerits; such is the reward of Gods enemies. They shall remain eternally in the fire of Hell, because they despise his Commandments. The wicked shall say at the day of Judgement, Lord, let us see the Devils, and the men that seduced us; we will trample them un^er our feet, and precipitate them to the bottom of h^l. Such as shall have professed the Law of God, as shall have obeyed his Commandments, shall be visite^ by the Angels, and shall that day be free from fear and affliction. They shall say unto them, Rejoyce ye in Paradice, that is prepared for you; ye shall there find all the contentments that ye shall desire; they have been prepared for you by the gracious and mercifull. There is nothing better then to pray to God, then to do good works, and to professe his unity. Good and evill are not a like: Ex^ell evill with thy good works. There is an exceeding great antipathy between Faith and Jmpiety: Faith is given to such as persevere to do well, and to them that are indued with the grace of God. The Devil will tempt thee, but implo^e assistance from God; he heareth and knoweth all things, The night and the day, the Sun and the Moon,  are signs of his Omnipotency: Adore neither the Sun, nor the Moon, worship God that created them. If the Infidels res^st the Faith, the Angels that are in Paradise defist not, notwithstanding, to exalt the glory of his divine Majesty, day and night, without intermission. It is a signe of his Omnipotency, to see the barren and dry Earth to change the face, and become green, when it is watered with rain. He that maketh the plants to revive, is he that maketh every thing to live and dye, he is Omnipotent. Such as depa^t from our Commandments, cannot hide themselves from us: Shall he that shall be precipitated into Hell, be better lodged then he that shall be saved at the day of Iudgment? Do what shall please you, your Lord beholdeth all your actions. I will chastise them thot traduce the Alcoran, it is a precious Book; it is approved by the ancient and modern Scriptures, it is sent from the glorious and mercifull. None other thing shall be spoken to thee, then what hath been spoken to the Prophets that preceeded thee; thy Lord is mercifull and just. Had we sent the Alcoran in the Persian tongue, to a Prophet; an Arabian by Nation; the wicked would have said, That the divine mysteries are not well explained. Say unto them, It is the guide of Believers, and a remedy to their ignorance. Infidels have deaf ears, they are blind, and hear not, a^ those that are called too far off: Certainly, we gave the Book and the Law to Moses. Vnbelievers doubt, but if thy Lord had not said, That he would defer their punishment untill the day of Iudgement, he had already chastised them in this world, because they doubt of the truth. Whosoever shall doe good, shall find good; and the evill that a man committeth shall be against him. Thy Lord doth no injustice to his Creatures: None but he knoweth the day of Iudgement; no fruit nor flower springeth out of the Earth, and woman neither conceiveth nor bringeth forth, but by his permission. Be thou mindful of the day that the lord shal cal Idolaters, and demand of them where be their Idols? They shall say, Lord, we acknowledg thy Vnity; None of us will hereafter adore those false gods. They that worshipped one God, departed  from Idolaters, they know that the punishment of their sin is infallible. Man never ceaseth to require riches, and is troubled when evill befalleth him; if we give him good after his affliction, he saith, that he foresaw it, and hath no thought of the comming of the day of Judgement; if he be converted, thy Lord openeth to him the gate of Paradise. I will make the wicked to know their wickednesse, and will most severely punish them; when we bestow wealth on man, he followeth his Idolatry and his sin, and when he is touched in affliction, he aboundeth in prayer: Say unto them, know ye not that the Alcoran proceedeth from God? neverthelesse ye have renounced it, who is more impious then he that impugneth the known truth? I will cause them to see my miracles, even to the utmost parts of heaven and earth, and in their own persons, to the end they may know the truth of the Alcoran. Sufficeth it not them that thy Lord seeth all things? neverthelesse, they are in doubt of the Resurrection, and of being assembled before him to be judged, certainly God is omniscient.   CHAP. XLII. The Chapter of Counsell, containing fifty and three Verses, written at Mecca. IN the Name of God, gracious and mercifull. God is prudent, wise, majestique, he understandeth all things, and is omnipotent; God hath sent thee the same inspirations that he sent to them that did precede thee; he is omnipotent and wise, whatsoever is in heaven and in earth appertaineth to him; he is omnipotent, and knoweth all things; the heavens open at his command, the Angels exalt his glory, and implore his pardon for them that are on earth; he is mercifull, he beholdeth them that invoke Idols, and knoweth them all, but thou art not their Tutor. We have inspired into thee the Alcoran in the Arabique tongue, to preach to the Inhabitanta of Mecca, and such as dwell about that City; we have sent thee to preach unto them the day of Judgement; there is no doubt that one  part of men shall be saved, and the other shall be damned; had it pleased God, he had created them of one and the same Religion, he giveth his grace to whom he listeth, and Infidels shall be deprived of succour, because they have required the protection of Idoles; but God is the true protector of the world: he reviveth the dead, and is omnipotent, he shall one day judge all the difficulties, and resolve all your doubts in your Religion, he is my Lord, I recommend my self to his divine Will; he created your wife of your selvs, he created all beasts male and female, and caused you to multiply; there is not any thing like unto him, he keepeth the keyes of the Treasures of heaven and earth, and taketh away, and giveth wealth as pleaseth him. The Law that I gave to Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, is that which I commanded thee to observe, viz. to believe in one God. The infidells are angry when thou preachest to them the unity of God, he teacheth it whom he pleaseth and guideth into the right way them that obey him; the wicked approve some points of his law, and reject the rest, although they have knowledge of his Vnity, and that through the envy that is risen among them; if thy Lord had not heretofore said that he would defer their punishment untill the day of Iudgment, he had already destroyed them; many of those, who after them shall have knowledg of the Scriptures shall doubt of his Law; but follow thou the way that is appointed thee, and follow not their appetites; Say unto them; I believe in the Book that God hath sent. I have received commandment to preach unto you that God is your, and our Lord; ye shall answer for your actions* and we shall answer for ours; it is not necessary to dispute against us, God will one day assemble us in his presence to judge our differences, he is our refuge; such as dispute against the faith after knowledge of the truth, are without reason? their arguments shall be vaine with God they shall be the object of his wrath, and shall suffer exceeding great pains. God hath sent the Alcoran with truth and ballance; he will not instruct thee when the day of judgment shal be: Such as have no faith in him, ask when it shal come, and they that believe him, fear the coming  thereof, and know it to be infallible; such as doubt, are erroneous from the right way. God is merciful to his people? and enricheth whom he pleaseth, he is strong and omnipotent, he encreaseth the graces of him that desireth the riches of Heaven; he giveth the wealth of the earth to them that effect it, and depriveth them of the riches of Heaven: Are there wicked ones among men that teach them a false Religion prohibited of God? God hath not revealed it to the^ had he not deferred their punishment until the day of Iudgmment, he had already destroyed them, they shall in the end feel grevious tormens, ye shal see the^ fear their own deportments, ye shall see them chastised after their demerits; and the believers that do good works, shall enjoy the delights of Paradise, where they shall finde whatsoever they shall desire, this is the great grace of God; this is that which he hath proclaimed to the faithfull that believed, and have done good works; say unto them, I require none other recompense for the pains that I take in preaching to you, then to love my kindred; he that shall do any good work shall be rewarded; God is mercifull, and good works are pleasing to him. Will they say that thou hast blasphemed against God? If it please God, he shall hinder thee to hear this discourse, or will imprint patience in thine heart; he abolisheth lies, and confirmeth the truth through his words; he knoweth whatsoever is in the hearts of men; he accepteth the conversion of his creatures, he pardoneth their sins, and knoweth all their actions; he heareth the prayers of the faithfull, that do good works, and augmenteth his grace upon them; but Infidels shall undergo the rigours of eternall pains. Had God equally enriched all his creatures, they had bin in confusion upon Earth he enricheth whom he pleaseth; he seeth and knoweth all; he sendeth rain when men despair of his grace, he is the protector of believers, and praise is due to him eternally: the creation of the Heavens, and of the earth, and of all that moveth betweene them, is a sign of thine omnipotency: If evil befal you, believe that ye have deserved it, neverthelesse he pardoneth you many things; ye cannot escape his punishment on earth, and none is able to protect you against him. The  Ves^el that runneth upon the water, big as a mountain, is a token of his omnipotency, to them that persevere in his Law, and acknowledg his graces. He shall reprove the wicked for their sins, and shall pardon many: They that dispute against his Commandments, cannot escape their punishent; the riches that ye possesse are the riches of the earth; the riches that God bestoweth on them that trust in him, are eternal: They that depart from mortall sins, that repent to have committed them, that beg of God to be heard, and persevere in their supplications; they that take councel, and consult among them what they ought to do, that employ in good works part of the wealth that God hath given them, that implore his help in their afflictions; such as do good, and such as commit evil, shall be recompensed, and punished according to their works. God abhorreth Infidels; ye have no power over them that implore his assistance in their affliction, and repent; your power extendeth over them that doin justice to the people; and d^sobey on earth the Commandments of his divine Majesty, they shall suffer great torments. Such as persevere in well-d^i^g, and pardon their Neighbour, do what God hath Commanded. He whom God shall m^sl^ad, shall finde none to guide him. Thou shalt see that the Infidels shall ask if they may return into the world, when they shall behold the fire of H^l; thou shalt see them flie with ex^ream fear of eternal ignominy; they shall look awry upon hell, and the believers shall see that the wicked, that have lost he^r Souls, that have misled their family, and all the impious, shall be eternally damned, none shall be able to save them, and he that God shall mislead, shall not finde the right way. Say unto them, beg pardon of God before the ^ay come, that ye shall finde no way to return into the world, nor excuse for your sins. If they disobey thee, we have not sent thee to be their Tutor; thou art sent only to preach unto them. When we give to man any p^osperity be rejoyceth, and when affliction befalleth him, ^e is ingrat^ful for the grace of his Lord, King of the heavens and earth God giveth children, sons and daughters ^o whom he pleaseth, he knoweth all things, and is omnipotent;  he speaketh not to man but by inspiration, and parable, without being seen; he sendeth his Prophets and Apostles into whom he inspireth what pleaseth him, he knoweth all things and is omnipotent; Thus have we sent thee our spirit to teach thee our Commandments; thou knowest not before what was written in the Alcoran, neither the misteries of faith we have sent it to thee to be a Light to the world, I will guide into the way of Salvation whom I please, I wil giude him into the way of the Lord, to whom belongeth all that is in Heaven and Earth, and who disposeth of all things.   CHAP. XLIII. The Chapter of Ornament, containing eighty and nine Verses, written at Mecca.  Exteri intituled This Chapter, the Chapter of Gold.  IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull: God is prudent and wise. I swear by the book that teacheth to do well, that we have sent it in the Arabique tongue, peradventure ye shall understand the Alcoran; it is written in in our originall Booke, majestique and mysterious. Shall I conceal from you the book of Salvation, if ye be wicked? How many Prophets and Apostles have we sent in past Ages, whom unbeleivers have despised? We destroyed the most powerful among them, and all have incurred the pain of their predecessors. If thou ask of them who created Heaven and Earth, they will say, that it is the omnipoten, who knoweth all things. Who hath extendeth the earth under you? Who established the wayes to guide you? It is God, he causeth the rain to descend from Heaven in your necessity; he maketh the dead, drie, and barren fields to revive; in like manner shall the dead come out of their Sepulchers. He it is that created whatsoever is in the world, of divers kinds and Species, and created the SHIPS, and BEAST, to carry you. Remember  the grace of your Lord, say, praised be he that created ^or us these things; we had not the power to create them. They all shall return before the Lord to be judged. The Infidels have divided God into many parts. Certainly he that saith that there are many Gods, is impious; hath he appointed you to say, that the Angels which he hath created are his daughters, seeing that he giveth you sonnes? When it is declared to some Infidels that a Daughter is born to him, he is not satisfied, (he desireth to have a son) will they say that God adorneth himselfe, and taketh ornaments to beautifie him like their Idols? It is a manifest error they say, that the Angels that worship God, are the daughters of his divine Majesty; I will write what they say, and will r^quire of them a^ accompt of their discourse at the day of Iudgement. They have said, had it pleased God, we had not adored the Angels; They know not what they say, and ignorantly blaspheme; do they observe any Scripture that hath been taught them heretofore? On the contrary, they say that their fathers lived in like manner, and that they follow their steps; they have said as much to all the Prophets that were sent unto them. When thou spakest to them to observe ^hat is contained in the Alcoran, and to abandon the Idols which their fathers worshipped, they answered, that they believed neither in thee, nor in thy mission; but we avenged our selves upon them; Consider what is the end of blaspheme^s; Remember thou, that Abraham said to his father, and his people, I am innocent of the sin that you commit, in adoring Idols, I wo^ship him alone that created me, he shall guide me into the way of Salvation, and hath left his words to posterity; perhaps the Infidels shall be converted. I deferred heretofore the punishment of Idolaters, until they had learned the truth and that a Prophet came to instruct them; When he preached unto them the truth, they said, that it is but witchcraft, and that they would give no faith to it. Had the Alcoran beene sent to a man, ^Olid bin Magui^he, and Ar^ua bin M^s^oud, in whom the Arabians had confidence. See Kitab el tenior. Master and Lord of two Cities, or Villages, they had esteemed and approved it. Would they dispose of the graces of GOD? He hath divided the riches of the  world among men; Some there be that are more eminent, and scorn each other, but the mercy of God is more advantageous then the riches of the Earth, which they accumulate: Although all the people be not of the same Religion, we cease not to bestow on the wicked houses adorned with seeling, enchased with silver, staires, doores, and Beds of silver and gold; These things are the riches of the Earth, and Paradise is for them that are righteous. I will cause to fall headlong with the Devils, such as shall reject the Law of the mercifull; the Devils shall be their companions, they shall seduce them from the way of Salvation, and they shall not know it. When we shall come to judge the Vniverse, they shall say, would to GOD we had been as remote from you, as the West is from the East. Oh what company for you! This day your repentance and your hopes shall be vaine; ye were Infidels for company, ye shall be companions in the Fire of Hel. Wilt thou make the blind to see, and the deafe to heare? Wilt thou guide them that wilfully erre? If they dye before being punished on Earth, I will be avenged on them in the other world. Shall I shew thee during thy life, the punishment that we have prepared for them? We can do it, but do thou only what hath been commanded thee, thou art in the way of salva^ion, instruct men therein; an accompt of thy mission shal be required of thee. I wil require an accompt of their mission that we sent heretofore to instruct the people, we wil demand of them, if we appointed them to worship any other God but us. Wee sent Moses to Pharoah, and his Ministers, he caused them to see our Miracles, and preached to them our Commandment; he told them that he was the Messenger of the God of the Vniverse, neverthelesse they scoffed. I shewed them no greater Miracle then that of Moses his sister, and we chastised them, because of their n^redulity. They said unto Moses, oh Magician! pray unto thy Lord, that he deliver us from these evils, and we will be converted; when they were delivered, they violated their promiser; and Pharoah said to his people, am not I King of Aegypt, doth not the River NILVS flow under my obedience? Know ye  not that I am more powerful then that poor wretch Moses, that knowes not what he sayes? Give him Pharoah caused bra^^lets of guil^ed Iron to be given, with Collers, to criminalls, and made the^ to go t^^o^gh the City. bracelets of Gold; we will see if the Angels, and those that follow his Doct^ine, will testifie the truth of his words. He terrified his Subjects, they obeyed him, for they were Infidels, but we were avenged on them when they provoked us; we drowned them, and made them serve for example to posterity, like those that preceeded them in impiety. The people would not hearken to the Sonne of Mary, when he spake by parable; they said, our Gods are more profitable to us then his lyes, and questions. On the contrary, they were refractory; he is our servant, we conferred on him our grace, and made him like to the other Prophets of the Children of Israel: Had it pleased me, I had created Angels on earth in your place; the comming of Jesus, the Sonne of Mary shall be a sign of the certainty of the day of Iudgment,See Gelaldin. And Kitab el tenoir. doubt not concerning that day. He said unto men, ^ollow me, it is the right way, beware lest the Devill seduce you, he is your open enemy. I come to teach you the Commandments of God, to resolve the doubts, and judg the differences that are among you; Fear God, and obey him he is your Lord and mine, worship him, it is the right way; The people doubted his Doctrine, but misery shall be upon the wicked, they shall suffer great torments at the day of ^udgement; will they expect that day for their conversion? it shall surprize them, and they know it not; that day shall they be enemies one of another, God shall say to the righteous, fear not, ye shall not this day resent any affliction; The believers that have obeyed my Commandments, shall enter into Paradise, you and your wives shall there rejoyce, ye shall* drink in cups of fine gold, ye shall there find whatsoever ye shall desire, and all that can content the minde, and delight the eyes, and ye shall dwell eternally in supream felicity; behold the Paradise that ye have gained by your good life! it is enriched with abundance of fruits, which ye shall eat with contentment; and the wicked shall remain eternally in the fire of Hell, they shall not be eased in their miseries, and shall be dum^ with despaire; we do no injustice to them,  they drew mischief on themselves, through their disobedience; They shall demand of the Keeper of the fire, will thy Lord never deliver ^s from these paines? He shall answer them, ye shall abide there Eternally; We have taught men the truth, but the greatest part of them would not believe it. The wicked have conspired against thee, and we conspired against them; think they that I know not their secrets, and whatsoever they utter? The Angels our Messengers keep accompt. Say unto them, if God have a Son, who shall we first adore? Praised be God, King of the Heavens and of the Earth; the matter is not as the Infidels deliver it: Leave them implunged in their impiety, let them Laugh and rejoyce, untill the day of their punishment arrive: One God alone ought to be worshiped in Heaven and Earth, he is most wise and omniscient. Praised be he to whom appertaineth the Kingdome of the Heavens and Earth, and whatsoever is between them. He knoweth the hour and the day, that all the world shall be assembled before him to be judged. The Idols that the Infidels adore, shall not be able to intercede for them; the good intercede for them tha^ have knowledge of the truth; If thou ask of men, who created them? they will say, it is God; How can they then depart from his Commandments? Lord, this peole is incredulous; Depart thou far form their company, they shall in the end, too late, acknowledg their errors.   CHAP. XLIIII. The Chapter of Smoke, cnotaining fifty nine Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. God is prudent and wise. I swear by the book that distinguish- the good from evil; that we sent it the night of blessing, to teach the people the torments of hel; this book explaineth our commandments, and al that we heretofore comanded the  Prophets; this is a speciall grace of thy Lord, he heareth and knoweth all things, he is Lord of Heaven and Earth, a^^ of all that is between them, beleive in his omnipotency. There is no God but he, he giveth life and death to whom he listeth, he is your Lord, the Lord of your fathers and predecessors; the wicked deride this discourse, but the day of judgment attends them; that day the heaven shal resemble smoak, that shall cover the world; that day shall the people say, behold here grievous torments; Lord deliver us from this misery, we will believe in thy Law: Their conversion shall be in vain, because when the Prophet preched to them, they scorned his words, and said, that he was a foolish teacher; and when they were comforted on earth, they returned to their impiety: Remember thou the day when they were vanquished, and taken by force, and that we were revenged on their impiety; We heretofore tryed the people of Pharoah; my beloved Prophet preached to them my Commandments, and said, Come follow me, oh ye servants of God! I am a faithful Messenger of his divine Maj. resist not his Law; I wil teach you his Comandments, he shal defend me from your malice he shal preserve me from being stoned; but if ye will not believe me, depart far from me. He prayed to his Lord, when he knew that that people were unbelieving and impious, God said unto him, goe by night out of the City with my servants if the men of Pharoah pursue thee, enter into the sea, through a path large and spacious, thine enemyes that shall follow thee shal be drownd. How many gardens, fountains, and places of pleasure, wherin they took delight, did they forsake? They fel into the power of another with al their treasures, and none lamented them, either in Heaven or earth; they expected not that punishment. We delivered the Children of Israel from Pharoahs tyranny, he was powerfull, and a great sinner. We elected them through our certain knowledg among all the world, and tryed them through our Miracles, and Commandments. The wicked say, we shall dye and not rise again; If the Resurrection be true, cause our fathers to revive to evidence the  ^ruth of thy words; Are they more powerful then their predecessors, whom we destroyed, because of their impiety? We have not created in vain the Heaven and the Earth, and whatsoever is between them; we created them for certain signes of our Vnity, the greatest part of the world understand it not; the day of Iudgment is th^ time appointed for their punishment, that day none shall be able to save his neighbour, or parent, or freind; nor shall any be saved, but those to whom God shall give his mercy, he is omnipotent and mercifull. The fruit of the Tree of Hel, called Zacon, shall serve for food to the wicked, it shal boil in their bellyes like pitch, or water. They shall cry, take the wicked, drag them into the fire of Hell, pour upon their heads all manner of torments. It shall bee said unto them, tast the pains of Hell; ye believed [your selves] to be the Omnipotent and precious on Earth, behold the punishment of which ye doubted! The righteous shall be in delicious places in Gardens adorned with Fountains; they shall be clothed with purple, they s^all behold each other face to face; we wil assemble them with women, pure and clean, who shall have most beautifull eyes, that shall have fruits savory and delicious, of all seasons; they shal never dye, and shall be delivered from the torments of Hell, through the special grace of thy Lord, behold supreme felicity! Certainly, we have sent the Alcoran in thy tongue, peradventure the Arabians will learn it; they covet thy ruine, but persevere thou, and expect the time of the punishment of their crimes.    CHAP. XLV. The Chapter of Genuflexion, or Knee-bowing, containing fifty nine Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and merciful. God is most prudent and wise. This Book is sent by the Omnipotent and wise. The Heavens and the Earth are most certain signes of his Vnity, to such as believe in his Law; your Creation, and the Creation of all Creatures, are marks of his greatnesse to them that have his fear before their Eyes; the difference of the night, and the day; the rain that he sendeth from Heaven, to cause fruits to spring out of the Earth, and to revive it after its death; and the diversity of wind^, are signes of his Omnipotency to them that have knowledg to comprehend it. I relate to thee the wonders of God with truth; in what will Infidels believe, if they believe not in the word of his divine Majesty? Misery is upon them that hear the Commandments of God, and become proud, as if they had not heard them. Preach unto such men, that they shall suffer ^he rigors of infinite pains. They deride the Faith when they are spoken to: Certainly, they be punished in the fire of Hell, their riches shall not be able to save them, neither the Idols which they adore; they shall be eternally damned. This Book guideth men into the way of salvation; they that shall not believe in the Law of God, shall feel the effects of his fury. He created the Seas that bear the Ships for the advantage of your commerce, peradventure ye will acknowledg this grace: He hath created for you, all that is in Heaven and on Earth; it is a sign of his goodness to such as consider it. Speak unto them that believe in the Law of Salvation, that they pardon those that have not the fear of God before their Eyes. God shall chastise them after their demirits. Whosoever shall do good, shall finde good; and ye shall be assembled before his divine Majesty, to be judged. Certaiuly we instructed the children Israel in the Scripture, and our Commandments; we taught them knowledg,  and gave them the grace of Prophesie; we enriched them with all sorts of riches, and preferred them to al the world. We taught them our Law, none disputed against our Commandmenes, but such as had knowledg, and that through the envy thar arose among them; but thy Lord shall judg their differences at the day of Iudgment. We have sent thee our Law, observe it, and follow not the appetites of the ignorant, they shall not be able to deliver thee from eternall pains. The Infidels obey each other, and the true-belivers obey God. This book is the light of the world, it guideth into the way of Salvation and the mercy of God, them that believe in his divine Majesty. Do the wicked imagine they shall be intreated like the godly in their life and death, and that they shall not be judged? God hath created heaven and earth for a mark of his power, he shall judg every one according to their works, and shall do injustice to none: Consider how they worship what cometh into their fancy, God hath seduced them from his certain knowledge, he hath rendred them deaf, hath hardned their heart, and blinded them; who shal guide, if God seduce them? Do they not consider it? They say our resurrection shal be like the life of this world; some dy, others are born; length of years cause us to die, they know not what they say, and speak but by opinion. When they are preached unto, they have no other' discourse to utter, but make our fathers to revive, if what we say be true. Say unto them, God causeth you to live and dy, and shal assemble you at the day of Iudgment; there is no doubt in this, but the greatest part of the people know it not. God is the King of the heavens and earth, and of the day of judgment; that day shall he assemble the Infidels; thou shalt see all Sects, and all Religions assembled before him upon their knees, every sect shall see their sins written in a particular book and shal be al chastised after their demerits, It shall be said unto them, behold the book that speaketh against you, we have exactly written what you have don; God shal give his mercy to the righteous, that is, supream felicity. It shal be said to the wicked, have not the Commandments of God bin preached to you? Ye became proud and were incredilous;  when it was told you that the promises of God and the day of Judgment were indubitable; ye said that i^ was but an opinion, and that ye believe it not; in the end ye shall acknowledge your offence, and shall suffer the pain^ that ye despised; God shall say unto them at the day of Iudgement, I have this day forgotten you, as ye forgot th^ coming of this day, the fi^e of hell shall be your habitation, none shall deliver you, because ye derided my Law, and waxed proud with the riches of the earth. They shall never get out of this Fire, neither be able to repent. Praise be to God, Lord of the heavens and earth, glory is due to him in all places, he is omnipotent and wise.   CHAP. XLVI. The Chapter of Hecaf, containing thirty five Verses, written at Mecca.  Hecaf is a Valley in the Country of Licmen, upon the frontiers of Ar^bi^. See Gelaldin, and the Book intituled, Kitab el Tenoir.  IN the name of God, gracious and merciful: God is most prudent and wise. This Book was sent by the Omnipotent and wise. We created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, for a sign of our Omnipotency and Vnity, and appointed to every thing a prefixed and limited time. If the Infidels depart from that which hath been preached to them, Say unto them, have ye considered the Idols that ye adore? shew me what they have created on earth, are they Gods companions in the creation of the heavens? bring me a Book sent from heaven before the Alcoran, that containeth like it, what remained of the doctrine of our Predecess^rs, we shall see if ye be true* who is more seduced then he that worshipeth things that can neither hear his prayers, nor protect him at the day of judgment? That day shall the Infidels be enemies to  each other, and the Idols shall not acknowledge them that have worshipped them. When they heard the Alcoran read, they affirmed it to contain the truth; and when they were commanded to observe it, they said, that it is but magick. Will they say that thou hast invented it? Say unto them, if I have invented it, ye cannot deliver me from the punishment of God, he knoweth all that is in this book, it is sufficient that he is witnesse between you and me, he is gracious and mercifull: Say unto them, I am not the first Prophet, nor the first Apostle that God hath sent, I know not what God shall determine of you and me, I do but what he hath inspired into me, and am sent to preach the torments of hel; have ye considered in what condition ye shall be, if the Alcoran be sent from God? Ye have renounced it, but one of the children of Israel is witnesse that it is sent from God, and hath believed in his divine Majesty, neverthelesse ye are become proud; God guideth not the proud. The Infidels say to the believers, if the Alcoran were any good thing, you should not exceed us in observing it, it guideth not into the way of salvation, it is but an old Fable; The book of Moses that came before it, teacheth the right way, and the Will of God: Say unto them, the Alcoran confirmeth the Scriptures sent heretofore to them that precedeed us, it is in the Arabique tongue; he preacheth the pains of hell to unbelievers, and declareth the joyes of Paradise to the righteous. Such as shall believe that God is their Lord, and shall obey him, ought to fear nothing, they shall suffer none affliction at the day of Judgment, they shall enjoy Pardadise for the reward of their good works. We have recommended to man, to honor father and mother, and to do good to them; his mother beareth him with pain, she bringeth forth with dolour, she giveth him suck, and weaneth him at the end of thirty moneths; she hath care [of him] until he be in a condition to govern himself, and hath attained to age of discretion. Then he saith, Lord, inspire me to be grateful for the grace that thou hast given to my father and mother; if I do well thou wilt accept it, take care of my posterity, I trust in thee, and desire to obey thy Commandments: Their prayer  shall be heard, their sins shall be pardoned, and they shall enjoy the joyes of Paradise, prepared for the righteous. He that shall ^peak to his father and mother in civility, and shall say unto them in derision, will ye bring me yet once more into the world after my death? wil ye revive me from my grave? many are dead heretofore, that are not returned: he shall be punished of God, his father and mother shall require help of his divine Majesty, and shall say unto him, my son, misery is with thee, believe in God, and in the Resurrection, the word o^ God is insallible; if he reply that it is an old Fable, he shall feel the punishment of God, the word of his divine Majesty shall be accomplished against him, as it hath been accomplished against them that did prece^e him in impiety, as well devills as men, they shal be damned; they shall be in ^undry degrees of payns, he shall chastise them after their demerits, and no injustice shall be don to them, It shall be said to the wicked that would depart out of hel fire, ye expelled your felicity, when ye lived in the world; your punishment was deferred until this present, ye shall this day be punished in this fire, because of your prid^ and crimes. Remember thou the brother of Aad, who preached the torments of HELL in the Valley of HECAF, his words was heard in his time, and are come to pop^sterity, viz. worship ^ut one God alone; i^ you do otherwise, I apprehend for you the day of Judgment: they answered him, art thou come to hinder us to adore our gods? let us ^ee the torments that thou preachest to us, if thou art true: he laid, God knoweth in what time he will chastise you; I preach to you what hath been appo^nted me to preach, but I see that ye are obstinate. When they beheld a black c^oud appear, which approached the place of their habitation, they said behold a cloud that shall give us rain; on the contrary, it is the punis^ment that ye have demaned, it is full of an in p^^^ous wind that shall destroy you though the Commandment of God in the Morning their houses were found empty of inhabitants: Thus God chastiseth the wicked, ye dwell in the places which they inhabited; they had hearts; eyes, and cares but their hearts, eyes, and ears were to them unpre^ntab^e; the  evill which they despised befell them, when they neglected to observe the commandments of God. We have destroyed whatsoever is round about Mecca, and have made the effects of our omnipotency to appear; paradventure the inhabitants thereof will be converted. The Idols that they worshiped, and those to whom they sacrificed, did not save them; on the contrary, they forsook them, because of their blasphemies-Remember thou, that we sent to thee devils, that desired to hear a Lecture of the Alcoran; when they heard thee, they said, Hark, he begins; and when thou madest an end they returned with exceeding great fear, and said to their companions, we have heard a Lecture of a Booke sent from heaven after the book of Moses, it confirmeth the ancient Scriptures, teacheth the truth, and guideth the people into the way of salvation. O people! hear him that calleth you to the Law of God, and to the observance of his Commandments; believe him, God shall pardon your sins, and deliver you from the pains of hell: such as shall not hearken to him, shall not escape the punishment of their crimes, and shall be deprived of protection at the day of Judgment; such men are seduced from the way of salvation. Consid^r they not that God, who created heaven and earth, did not labour in creating them? that he is able to give life and death, and is omniponent? Be thou mindfull of the day that the Infidels shall desire to get out of the fire of hell; it shall be said unto them, are not the pains that were preached to you true? they shall say, yes Lord; it shall be said to them, taste then the torments which ye have merited through your impiety. Persevere thou, as the Prophets thy pedecessors persevered. Be not impatient, till thou see the punishment of Infidels; they shall see it when they shall rise againe, and shall believe that they have been but an hour in their sepulchres: This is that which God hath commanded to preach, he shall destroy those only that disobey his Commandments.    CHAP. XLVII. The Chapter of the Combat, containing fourscore and eight Verses written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and merciful. Good works are vain and unprofitable to the wicked, and to them that hinder their neighbour to follow the Law of God; he pardoneth their sins who beleive in what Mahomet hath preached; it is the very truth that proceedeth from his divine Majesty, but the Infidels have followed vanity, and the believers have embraced the truth sent from their Lord; Thus God speaketh to the people in parables. When ye shall meet the Infidels in time of warre, cut their necks, pursue them untill ye take them prisoners, then bind them; after this, ye shal either give them liberty or put them to ransom, untill their party shall lay down arms. If God pleased, he could give you victory without fighting, but his will is to prove you; he guideth into Paradise, them that are slain for the defence of his Law, and giveth them his grace. Oh ye that believe in God! If ye protect the Law of God, God will protect you, he wil confirm your steps, and destroy the Infidels, because they have contemned his commandments, and their good works shall be to them unprofitable; consider they not what hath been the end of the impious that were before them, and that God hath destroyed them; Hee shall destroy them in like manner, because he protecteth the Believers, and Infidels are deprived of his protection; he maketh the righteous to enter into Paradise, into gardens wh^reof flow many rivers, The punishment of the wicked is sometimes deferred in this world, they live like beasts, but the fire of Hell is prepared for their punishment. How many cities,Mecca. stronger, and more opulent then that which they caused thee to abandon, have we destroyed? They found no prot^ction. Are such as embrace the Law of God like to them that follow their own appetites ? God hath promise^ Paradise to them that have his fear before their eyes;  there be in Paradise rivers of water, that receiveth no alteration; there be rivers of milk that never corrupteth, rivers of wine, savory and delicioius to the taste; rivers of honey, pure and clean; fruits of all sorts, and the grace of God for them that shall obey his Commandments; the wicked shal remain eternally in the fire of Hell, where they shall drink a boyling liquor, that shall burn their entrails. There be persons among the Infidels, that hear what thou dost preach when they are gone from thee; their Doctors demand of them what thou hast said concerning the day of Iudgment? God hath hardned the hearts of such men, and they shall never follow but their own passions. God encreaseth the graces of them that obey his Commandments, and fortifyeth them in their perseverance; Shall the Infidells tarry untill the day of Iudgement surprizeth them. The signes of that day hath already appeared, that day shall repentance be in vain; There is no God but God, implore from him pardon of thy sin; and for these men and Women, that believe in his Law, he knoweth what they doe day and night; If the Chapter of the place where Justice is rendred, had not been sent and had not made mention of Combats, thou hadst not seen them that doubt of the Law look upon thee with eyes troubled, because of their fears of dying. Teach them obedience, and speak to them with civility. Had they believed, and obeyed, when they were appointed to fight, they had performed a good work. Have ye disobeyed? Have ye abandoned the Law of God, to defile the earth? and to deprive your s^lves of his mercy? God rendreth them whom he curseth, and who comprehend not the truth of the Alcoran, deaf and blind. Have they a firm heart? Such as have returned to their impiery, after having known the right way, were tempted of the Devil, and particularly, when they told the Infidels that they would obey them in any thing, God knowetth all their secrets; what wi^l become of them when the Angels shall cause them to dye? they shall beat them before and behied, be^ause they have in^urred the wrath of God, and desp^sed his Commandmen^s; their good works shall be unprof^^able; think they tha^ God will never make manifest their  malice? If thou wilt, I wil make it appear, thou shalt know them by their countenance, thou shalt discover them by their voyce, and speech. Say unto them, God knoweth all your actions; he shall prove you, to discover the believers, and the unbelievers. The wicked, who hinder the people to follow the way of salvation, that contradict the Prophet, after they have had knowledg of the Law of God hurt not his divine Majesty, their actions are vain unprofirable. Oh ye that believe! obey God, and his Prophet, and render not your good works ineffectuall through disobedience; he pardoneth not the wicked; who seduce the people from the way of Salvation, and dye in their impiety; Be not fainted-hearted and slothfull ye shall be victorious; God is with you. He will not deprive you of reward; the life of this world is but foolish pastime and delusion; if yee believe in God; and have his fear before your eyes, he will recompense for your good works, he requireth not an accompt of your riches; if he do require it [of you] it is to hinder you to be avaricious, and to banish usury from among them that believe in his Law: Oh people! ye are commanded to make some expence for the love of God; he that shall be a niggard and avaricious; in this occurrence, shall be avaricious and a niggard to himself. God is rich, and ye are poor; If ye despise his Law, he will create in your place other persons, that shall not do like you.    CHAP. XLVIII. The Chapter of Conquest, containing twenty nine Verses, written at Mecca.  This is the Chapter, Of the taking of the City of Mecca.  IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. We have given thee a manifest victory. God pardoneth the sinne that thou didst commit, when thou wert too prompt, and when thou wert too tardy, [to fight for his Law;] he shall accomplish his grace upon thee, he shall guide thee into the right way, and shall powerfully protect thee; he hath delivered the hearts of the believers from fear, to augment their faith; he disposeth the forces of the Heavens and Earth, he knoweth all, and is most prudent. He shall make them that shall obey his Commandments, to dwell in Gardens, wherein flow many rivers, and shall remit to them their offences, this is supream felicity; The Infidels, the wicked, the disobedient, and unjust, that have evill thoughts of God, shall be accursed of his divine Majesty, misery shal alwayes pursue them, and his wrath be eternally upon them; he hath prepared for them the pains of Hell. God disposeth the powers of the Heavens and Earth, he is omnipotent and wise. We have sent thee to be witnesse of the deportments of those of the Nation, to proclaime to them the joyes of Paradise, and to preach to them the pains of hell, to the end they may believe in God, and in his Prophet; that they may praise him, honour him, and exalt his glory evening and morning; Such as shall obey thee, obey God; the hand of God is stronger then the hand of men; he that shall sin, shall offend against his own soul; and he that performed what he hath promised to God, shall have an exceeding great reward. Such of the Ara^ians as have no inclination to ^ollo^ thee, say, thou imployest our WEALTH and PERSONS to goe with thee* implore therefore pardon of God for us; but they speake not  with the mouth, what they have in the heart; Say unto them, who but God is able to do ought for you? if it be his will to bring good or evil upon you, he is omnipotent, and knoweth all that you do. Ye believed that the Prophet and True-believers should be slain when they fought for the Law of God; ye believed that they should never return to their houses. This opinion rejoyced your heart, but you were deceived, and were your selves destroyed with them that believed not in God, nor his Prophets, God hath prepared the fire of hell for Infidels; the Kingdome of the heavens and earth appertaineth to him, he punisheth and chastiseth whom he listeth, he is gracious and mercifull. When ye shall go to the spoil, such as refused before to follow you to the sight, will say, permit us to go with you; they would pervert the Word of God. Say unto them, ye shall not follow us in this occasion. God hath not heretofore ordained it; they will reply, certainly ye are envious, against us; on the contrary, they understand not the Law of God, except very few among them. Say to the Arabians, that refused to follow thee, ye shall be called to fight against miserable men, yee shall fight them, neverthel^sse they shall still be obedient to God; if yee obey and fight for the Faith, he will largely reward you; if ye desert his service, as heretofore ye have done, he shall severely chastise you. The blinde, the lame, and the sick, are not obliged to go to the war. He that shall obey God and his Prophet, shall dwell eternally in gardens, wherein flow many rivers; and he that shall disobey Gods Commandments, shall be punished for his disobedience. God accepted their action that repaired to thee under the tree, he knew what they had in their hearts, their confirmed he steps, and gave them victory, he is omnipotent and wise. God had promised you great spoil, he gave it you, and delivered you from the hands of the people; this shall serve for a sign of his omnipotency to the true-lievers, he will conduct you in to the right way; none but you could have atchieved that conquest, he well knew that that was for none other, he is omnipotent: if the wicked fight you, they shall fly, they shall turn the back, and finde none to  protect them. Observe the Law of God against them, do as was heretofore commanded you; the Law of God admits no alteration; God hath delivered you from their hands, and delivered them into yours in the midst of Mecca, having given you victory over them; he beholdeth all their actions, they have despised the Commandments of his divine Majesty, and hindred you heretofore to go to the Temple of Mecca; they are at present prisoners; without the assistance of the true-believers that were within the City with you, ye had not known them, ye had trampled them under our foot without distinction, and had offended God without knowledg of your sin. God bestoweth his mercy on whom he pleaseth; had ye been separated from the unbelievers, we had severely punished them. When they were succoured of the ignorant, and had some advantage, God put his Prophet, and all the believers in a place of safty, they had recourse to the word of force and vertue, wherein they did better then the Infidels, God knoweth all. Assuredly the dream of the Prophet of God was true, when he dreamed that ye were in the Temple of Mecca without fear, your hair shaven, and beards trimed; fear nothing, God knoweth what you know not; in lieu of this dream, he hath given you a great victory; he it is that hath sent you his Prophet, to teach you his Law, more salutary then all other Laws of the world. It is sufficient, that God is witnesse that Mahomet is his Prophet and Apostle; it sufficeth that the true believers who are with him, bear testimony. God encreaseth his mercy towards those Infidels that convert; thou shalt see them worship God, humble themselves before his divine Majesty, and implore his grace; thou shalt know them by their aspect, they shall have in their countenance the marks of their zeal; it is so written in the old Testament and she Gospel; they are like a plant that produceth its leaves, that grows strong by little and little, and becommeth big, afterwards it taketh strength upon its roots, becometh a great tree, and the wood thereof serveth to make war against Infidels. God hath promised his mercy, and an exceeding great reward to the Infidels that shall be converted, that shall believe in his Law* and do good works.    CHAP. XLIX. The Chapter of Inclosures, containing eighteene Verses written at Medina.  Exteri intituled This Chapter, the Chapter Of Walls.  IN the name of God, gracious and merciful. O ye that belevie! prefer not what ye have done, to what God and his Prophet hath performed, and fear God, he heareth what soever ye say, and seeth all that ye do. O ye that beleieve! when ye shall speak to the Prophet, speak not louder then he; cry not, as when ye talk among your selves, least ye render your good works vain and unprofitable, and know it not; God hath tryed the vertue of them that speak low in the presence of the Prophet, he shall pardon their sinns, and give them an exceeding great reward. They that call thee behind the Inclosures, know not what they do; had they attended untill thou hadst been towards them, they had done very well, God is gracious and merciful. O ye that believe! if any Infidel desireth to preach to you, distinguish the truth from a lye; if ye give credit to the ignorant, ye shall repent you. Know that the Apostle of God is among you; ye shall offend God, if ye obey unbelievers in many things, God willeth that ye embrace his Law, it shal rejoyce your hearts; and make ye to abhorre disobedience and impiety: such as abhorre it, are stedfast in their faith, through his speciall grace, he knoweth them, and is most wise. I^ two Nations, or two Provinces, of such as believe in God are at odds, reconcile them; if the one doe injury to the other, fight against him that is unjust untill he repai^e what God hath ordained; if he make reparation, reconcile them with equity; be just, God loveth them that do justice to his people: all those that believe in his LAW, are BRETHREN; make peace among your brethren, and fear God, he shall give you his mercy O ye that believe! scorn not your neighbour peradventure that he shall one day be of better value then  you. O ye women! scorn not others, perhaps they shall one day be more worth then you. Vtter no reproaches, and give no name to your neighbour that may displease him; call him by his name, otherwise ye will disobey God: such as repent not, are exceedingly too blame. O ye that believe in God! take heed of evill thoughts, these are oftentimes in the number of sins; do no displeasure to your neighbour, and speak to each other nothing that may displease: who among you would eat the flesh of his dead brother? ye shall abhor it; fear therefore God, who is gracious and merciful to such as have his fear before their eyes. O people! we created you male and female; we have caused to issue out of your loyns people and Nations; ye koow each other, but your greatest honour is, to fear God, he knoweth you, and understandeth, all your secrets. Some among the Arabians have said, we believe; say unto them, say not we believe, but say, we are obedient, otherwise faith shall not enter into your hearts; if ye obey God and his Prophet, ye shall be recompenced for your good works, God is gracious and merciful to them that obey his Commandments. Such as are beloved of God, believe in his Vnity, and in his Prophet, they doub not of his Law, and imploy their persons and wealth for the propagation of the faith. Say unto them, know ye not that your Law proceedeth from God? he knoweth whatsoever is in the heavens and earth, he knoweth all. They think to do thee a pleasure in saving them, say unto them, believe not that ye pleasure me, for it is God that guideth you into the way of salvation; ye ought so to believe it; God knoweth all that is in the heavens and earth, and beholdeth whatsoever ye do.    CHAP. L The Chapter of the Thing Judged, containing fourty five Verses written at Mecca.  Mahomet hath intituled this Chapter with the letter Kaf of the Arabique Alphabet, which signifyeth in this place, Kda el mer, that is to say, the thing judged; See Gelaldin, and Bedaoi, who have entituled this the Chapter of Judgment, or the thing judged. Many Mahomitans say likewise, that Kaf is a mountain that environeth the world, and that Mahomet swore by that Mountain.  IN the name of God, gracious and merciful. I swear by the Alcoran, worthy of praise, that the Inhabitants of Mecca wonder that a man of their Nation teacheth them the torments of hell; they say, that he speaketh strange things. What, say they, shall we die? shall we be earth, and return into the world? Behold a very strong return! We know assuredly what the earth will do with us, we have a book, wherein all is written; they impugne the known truth, and are in a great confusion: See they not heaven above them, how we have built it? how we have adorned it? and how there is no defect? We have extended the earth, raised the mountains, and caused all sorts of fruits to spring forth, for a sign of our omnipotency. We have sent the blessed raine from heaven, made gardens to produce grain, pleasing to the Reapers, and Date trees, exceeding each other in height, to enrich our creatures. We have given life to the dead, dry, and barren earth; so shall the dead come out of their sepulchers. The peopl of Noahs time, those that inhabited ne^r the wel, Temod, Pharoah, and the fellow Citizens of Lot; they that d^elt in the Forrest, and people of King Teba, did heretofore traduce our Prophets,Teba was a King of Lieme^. and felt the punishment denounced against Infidells. Was it a trouble to us to create men at first? neverthelesse they ere in doubt if they shall rise again.See ^edaoi  We created man without difficulty, we know the mo^ions of his soul, and penetrate into his heart as the bloud in to the veins of his body. O man! think upon the day that thou shalt see thy good and evill Angell near thee, at the right hand, and on thy left, they have observed and written all that thou hast done; represent to thy self death before thine eies, it is inevitable: Think on the Angel that shall sound the Trumpet at the day of the Resurrection; that day shall the wicked behold what was promised them, and all men shall come before God to be judged. Their guardian Angels shall conduct them, and be the witnesses of their deportments: It shall be said to the Infidells, behold the day of which ye would have no thoughts; we have now opened your eyes, you shal see this day more hard then iron; their guardian Angells shall say unto them, behold here b^fore your eyes all that ye have done; cast into Hell those obstinate Infidels, that have hindrd their neighbour to do good, that have offended in doubting of Gods Law, and have affirmed there was another god with God; cast them into the most grievous torments. Then shall the Devill say to them, Lord, I did not seduce them, they seduced themselves; God shall say, dispute not before me, what was heretofore promised you is infallible, my Word admitteth no alteration, and I will do injustice to none. God shall ask at the day of judgment, if hell be full? it shall answer, is there any more? Paradise is prepared for the^ righteous, who shal have the fear of God before their eyes, it is promised to the^ that shall be converted, that shall obey the Commendments of his divine Majesty, and persevere in their obendience. It shall be said to them, enter ye into Paradise, exempt from all evill; behold the eternall day, ye shall have all that ye shall desire and more. How rich and powerful Cities have we in times past destroyed? their inhabitants sought in their Countryes places of retreat, and escaped not the punishment of their crimes; this ought to serve for example to them that comprehend it, to them that hear it, and to such that saw it. Certainly we created in six dayes, without difficulty, the heaven and earth, and all that is between them. Persevere, be not impatient for the words of unbelievers,  exalt the glory of thy Lord before the Sun go down, an^ before it rise; pray to thy Lord at the entrance of the night, the last of all shall be worship. Hearken when the Angel shall call thee to generall Judgment; that day shall all the world hear the Trumpet; the people shall come out of their sepulchers, and earth shall open before the eyes of men, I give life and death, and all the world shall be assembled before me to be judged. This assemble is easie for me to accomplish; I know what the wicked say, thou shal^ not cause them by force to embrace my Law* teach it those that fear the torments prepared for Infidels.   CHAP. LI. The Chapter of Things dispersed, containing sixty Verses,Gelaldin Falkredin intitle this the Capter of things that disperse. writen at Mecca. IN the Name of God, gracious and mercifull. I swear by the winds that disperse the dust, by ^he clouds charged with rain, by the ship that runneth upon the waters, and by them that divide the wealth of the earth; that what hath been promised to you is true, and that the day of Judgment is infallible. I swear by heaven, and the stars thereof, that ye are in an exceeding great error; God expelleth lyars far from him, he curseth them that blasphem, and such as beleive not in the Resurrection: They ask, when shall be the day of Judgment? That day shall they be punished in the fire of hell. It shall be said unto them, taste the torments that ye have with impatience demanded. They who had the fear of God befo^e their eyes, shall be in gardens, adorned with fountains, they shall enjoy the pleasures prepared for them by God, because they are righteous; ^hey sleep very little by night, implore pardon of God at the dawning of the day, and give almes to the poor that beg, and the poor that are bashfull. God manifesteth on the earth, and in your persons the signs of his omnipotenc^; consider ye not that what is promised to you is written  in heaven? God is Lord of heaven and earth, he is truth it self, wil ye not confess him? ^^d the Angels conveigh to th^e the books of Abraham? Wh^n they ^ntred into his house, they saluted him; he likewise saluted them, made signs to his ^ervants to bring a fat calf roasted, which he presented to them; he said unto them, wherefore do ye not eat? and was afraid in his mind, of their coming. They said, fear not, we are the Messengers of God; they declared to him that he should have a son, that should be a great personage. Then his wife drew near crying with a loud voice, and smiting her face, said, one that is barren beareth no child; they said, the thing shall come to pass as we have spoken, thy Lord ordaineth what pleaseth him, and knoweth all. Abraham said unto them, O ye Messengers of God! what is your design? they replied, we are sent from God to destroy the Cities inhabited by the wicked, and cast upon them stones of fire, whereon are inscribed the names of them that they shall strike: we will cau^e all the righteous to depart from among them; if we finde there but one family of righteous, we will there leave an example to posterity for them that fear the tormen^s of hel. Moses is a sign of our omnipotency; we sent him to Pharoah with reasons clear and intelligible, he despised my Commandments, and said, that Moses was a Magician, and possessed of the devil, but we surprised him, and drowned his people, to his great displeasure; Aad is an example of our omnipotency: we sent an impetuous winde against those wicked people that destroyed them. Temod is an example of our omnipotency, with his Nation; they waxed prou^, and resisted the Commandments of their Lord; when it was said to them, that the punishment of the wicked was defer^ed to another time, but thunder surprised th^m, they saw it, they had not the power to stand on their feet, and were deprived of protection. The people of Noahs time are an example of our omnipotency, we p^stroyed them, because they were impi^us: we built heaven with strength and vertue; I am he that giveth power and strength; we extended the earth, and created of every thing, male and female; perhaps ye will consider it. Say unto them, turn ye to God; I am sent from him  to preach to you the pains of hell: believe not that God hath another God with him; the wicked said heretofore, that the Prophets and Apostles whom he sent, were Magicians, and possessed of the Devil: have they recommended to their posterity to do the like? Certainly they are in a great error. Separate thy self far from their company, and be not troubled at what they say; preach the Alcoran, it is profitable to the righteous; I did not create the devils and men but to worship me. Say unto them, I require nothing of unbelievers for instructing them; I require not that they nourish me, God enricheth whom he pleaseth, he is omnipotent; the wicked shall be chastised as heretofore have been their predecessors, in their malice, their time shal come, and misery shall befal them at the day of judgment.   CHAP. LII. The Chapter of the Mountain, containing thirty nine Verses written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and merciful. I swear by the Mountain, upon which God spake to Moses by what is contained in the book written in parchment, by the first Temple of Mecca, by the arches of the heavens, and by the sea full of water, that God is one sole God and the punishment promised to unbelievers is infallible, they shall not be able to escape it in the day when the heaven shal tremble, and the mountains shall w^^^ ^^at day shall be unhappy (...) ^^ated in the fire (...) that ye (...) pa^^ (...) our (...) ^ore (...) ^od (...) ^e (...) ^d (...) ^d (...)  works; they shall repose upon beds well ordered, we will marry them to wives that shall have fair eyes, they shall be attended of their family, and be largly rewarded for their good works; every good action shall be to them a degree of happiness; We will give them such fruits and Vines as they shall desire; they shall present to each other the cup to drink, they shall not speak an evill word, and shall not si^; they shall have pages about them for their service, beautifull as pollished pearls, they shall discourse among them, concerning what they did before on Earth, and say, We were in the world, we and our families, with a great apprehension of the pains of hell, but God hath gratified us, he hath delivered us from eternall flames. They shall say moreover, we worshipped in the world but one God, most just, and most mercifull. Remember thou to preach the Alcoran; thou art not ingratefull for the grace of God, thou art not possessed of the Devill; will they say that thou art a Poet, a Rimer? that nothing must be expected from thee but fables of past Ages? Say unto them, ye expect the time of my destruction, but I with you, expect the time of your [ruine.] Do their superiors command them to speak in this manner? Will they be obstinate in their errors? Will they say, that Mahomet hath invented the Alcoran? Certainly they are incredulous, let them bring any discourse like to this book, in Doctrine and Eloquence, if what they affirm be true. Were they created of any thing? have they created any thing? have they created themselves? have they created the Heavens and the Earth? Certainly they are incredulous: Have they in their power the treasures of thy Lord? are they Gyants? Have they a ladder, that may raise them to hear what is spoken in Heaven? Let them produce some reason of their opinion; Believe ye that God hath daughters, and that ye have sonnes? Will ye require of him a Salary for obeying his Law? Is he your debtor? The wicked are lyars* do they know what shall be? do they weite it? Desire they to conspire against thee? The wicked often conspire against the righteous, that worship but one God: Praised be God, he hath no companion; If the Infidels should see a piece of the Heaven to  fall, they would say, it is a cloud driven by the winds; leave them in their obstinacy, untill they come to the day of their death, that day shall their conspiracy be vain, and they deprived of protection: They likewise shall be punished before their death, but the greatest part know it not. Have pacience, and expect the Judgment of God, thou shalt soon see it; I will protect thee, and thou shalt not want help; Praise thy Lord, exalt his glory when thou shalt rise, praise him in the night, and before the Stars disappear.   CHAP. LIII The Chapter of the Starre, containing sixty Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and merciful. I swear by the Star that disappeareth, that your friend Mahomet ^rreth not, he speaketh nothing of his own, he speaketh but what hath been inspired into him by the omnipotent, and most bountifull* God. The Angell approached him in the highest place of heaven, within the length of two bowes; and somewhat nearer;The Turks believe that there is an Apple tree at the right side of throne of God, and that none can ascend higher then its branches, no not the angels. God hath inspired into him, what he hath inspired into his servant, who altered nothing of what hath been inspired into him. He hath spoken what he hath seen, and in what form the Angel was. Dispute not against him, concerning what he saw; he another time saw the Angel in Heaven, near to the Tree that is at the right side of Gods throne; and although that tree was covered with that which covered him, his fight was not dazled, and he is not in error. Certainly he hath seen the great wonders of his Lord: Have ye considered Alat, Az, and Menat, those three Idols? Will ye s^^are that God hath daughters, and that ye have Sonnes? ye will make a false Oath, and shall be in a manifest error; Those Idols have nothing but the names which your Fathers and you have given them,See Gelaldin. God hath not commanded you  to worship them, ye follow only your passions, remote from the truth, God teacheth you the way of Salvation by the mouth of his Prophet; doth man obtain from Idols what he required of them? God is God in the beginning, and the end; How many Angels be there in Heaven, whose prayers are unprofitable, if God doth not accept them? They that believe not in the day of Judgment, say, that Angels are maidens, they understand not what they say; they speak through opinion, and that opinion is not conformed to truth. Depart thou farre from them that reject our Law, and desire only the goods of the Earth, and are ignorant of all other things. Thy Lord knoweth them that go a stray from the right way, and such as follow the path of Salvation; all that is in the Heavens, and Earth, is Gods, he shall chastise the wicked,See Gelaldin. and reward the just. He pardoneth their veniall sinnes, who flie sinnes mortall, he is exceeding merciful. He knoweth that he hath created you of Earth,Great and small sins. and that he formed you in your mothers womb. Extol not your selves, he knoweth such as have his fear before their eyes. Hast thou seen him that abandoned the faith? a little wealth was given him, and nothing more; doth he know what must befall him? hath he knowledg of what is to come? will he not learn what is written in the books of Moses and Abraham? to wit, that none shall bear the burden of another; man shal have but what he shal have gained; he shal in the end see his labour be rewarded after his works, and all shall appear in the presence of thy Lord. H^ it is that causeth to laugh and mourn, to live and to dye; he created the male and female of every thing, he giveth and taketh away mans soul, when he listeth; he is most rich, and hath no want of any person. He is the Lord of the Planet, which men adored. He destroyed A^^ and Temod, drowned the people of Noah, who were most erroneous and unjust, overthrew the City of Lot, and covered it with burning stone. In whom will they believe, if they believe not in thy Lord? This Prophet is sent to preach to you the pains of hel, as did the other Prophets that were before you; The day of Judgment approacheth, and none but God  knoweth when it will come; wonder ye at this discourse? Ye scoffe, and lament not when ye are spoken to, but ye shal be surprized in your sin, if ye humble not your selves before God, neither worship him.   CHAP. XLVII. The Chapter of the Moon, containing fifty five Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. The day of Iudgment approacheth, the Moon was divided into two parts, nevertheless Infidels believe not miracles when they see them; they say that this is Magick, they lie, and follow but their passion, but as is written. The history of past ages, full of salutery counsels, was preached to them; neverthelesse Preachers were to them unprofitable; Depart thou far from them, when they shall be called to the universall Judgement; which they will not believe; that day shall their eyes be troubled with feare; they shall come out of the Earth, dispersed; like frighted GRASSEHOPPERS, they shall flock to him that shal summon the^ Judgment, and shall say, behold here a day unhappy for the wicked. The people heretofore belyed Noah, and said, that he was possessed of the Devill; Noah exhorted them, and invoked his Lord; in the end, he said, that his strength was gon, and that he was overcome through the malice of men, then was he powerfully succored; we opened the gate of the Heavens, and caused an extraordinary raine to fall, wee caused FOVNTAINES to issue ^orth from under the Earth, the water of Heaven and Earth were gathered together, and overwhelmed the Infidels, because of their sins; We saved Noah in the Arke, well pinned, and chaulked it floated upon the water trough our p^^mission, to serve for a token of our omnipotency; will any of the vn^elievers of this time consider this? will they consider the punishment of their crimes, and the  pains of Hell? We have made the Alcoran easie to be understood, will there be any that study it? The wicked that traduced Aad were chastised, but with what chastisement? We sent against them an impetuous wind, in a day to them unfortunate, that caused men to fall like palms rooted up, consider what was their puishment; We have rendred the Alcoran intelligible, will there be any one that will study it? Temod and his people traduced the Prophets, and contemned their exhortations; they said, there is a man among us, who would seduce us from the right way, if ye follow him, he will lead you into Hel^; was he alone elected among us, to receive the inspirations of God? No, he is an Imposter; but in the end, they knew them that were wicked, and lyars. We sent the Camell to prove the Infidels; their Prophet observed what they did, and was patient, the water was divided for them and for the Camel, and each at his day found to drinke, neverthelesse they called their Companions, and slew the Camell of Salhe, but in what manner were they chastised? I darted thunder against them; which made them drie as chaffe; We have made the Alcoran easie to be understood, will there be any to study it? Lots Citizens traduced him, and despised his instructions; We sent against them an hot winde, with burning stones, that destroyed them, and we in the morning saved Lot, with his family, throught our speciall grace; thus do I recompense them that ackowledge my benefits. Lot had preached to them the pains of hel, we surprized them, when they disputed against his exhortations, they saw his guests to enter into the city, in the figure of men; we blinded their sight, and said, Tast oh ye wicked! the punishment of your crimes; In the morning they wery chastised with a perpetuall chastisement, because they despised the words of Lot* We have made the Alcoran intelligible, will there be any that will study it? Certainly the men of Pharo^h were preached un^o; they would not obey my Law, and despised my miracles, but we surprized them in their sinnes; Are the Infidels that are among you of more value then those that preceded them? Finde ye any Salvation for them in the SCRIPTVRE? Will they say they shall  obtain victory over the believers? On the contrary, they are vanquished, and turn the back. Certainly the hour of their punishment shall speedily come, their time approacheth, and their pain in Hell shall be greater then that of the Earth, they are wholly seduced from the way of Salvation, and shall be dragged, and cast headlong into eternal flames. We have created all things by our sole power; we spake but one word, and in the twinckling of an eye the thing wa^; we heretofore destroyed a great number of Infidels like unto them, will there be any that considereth it? All the good, and the evill that they have done is exactly written. The righteous shall dwell in pleasant gardens, they shall drink in eternall rivers, they shall not speak a lye in their assemblies, and shall dwell eternally near to the most majestique and omnipotent God.   CHAP. LV. The Chapter of the Mercifull, containing eighteen Verses, written at Medina. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. The mercifull hath taught the Alcoran; he hath created man, and given him the use of reason; he created the Sun and the Moon to count seasons, the Stars and Trees adore him; he hath elevated the Heavens, established Justice, and commanded to weigh with good weights; he hath created the Earth for the habitation of men, with all sorts of fruits, g^ain, and leaves; he created the winds and tempests: Oh men and Devils! what Lord do ye blaspheme, but your own Lord? He created man of Earth, like a pot, and the Devils of the flame of fire; what Lord do ye blaspheme, but your own Lord? He is the Lord of both the Wests, and both the Easts, what Lord do you blasphem, but your own Lord? He maketh the fresh water to mingle with the salt, and the one easily mingleth with the other; what Lord do ye blaspheme, but your own Lord? be bring^^^ Pearls, and Corrall out of the Sea; what Lord  do ye blaspeme, but your own Lord? he created the Ships that float upon the Sea, big as mountains; what Lord do ye blaspheme, but your own Lord? Al things shall have end, and the majestique and glorious face of thy Lord shal be permanent; what Lord do ye blaspheme, but your own Lord? Whatsoever is in Heaven and in Earth, imploreth his grace, he is ever himself; what Lord do ye blasphem^e, but your own Lord? Oh ye men and Devils! I will require an account of your actions; what Lord will ye blaspheme, but your own Lord? Oh ye men and Devills! passe the extremities of Heaven and Earth, go beyond them if ye can, ye have not the power, what Lord do ye blaspheme but your owne Lord? If he send against you flames without smoak; and smoake without fire, ye cannot defend your selves; what Lord do ye blaspheme, but your owne Lord? When the heaven openeth, it resembleth a rose, or a crimson coloured skin; what Lord do ye blaspheme, but your own Lord? The time will come, when ^n accompt shall be required from men and Devils of their sinnes; what Lord do ye blaspheme, but your Lord? The wicked shall be known by their countenance, an accompt shall be required of their readinesse and negligence; what Lord do ye plaspheme, but your own Lord? Behold hell! which the wicked would not believe; they shall turn round about, and round about, in boyling water, of which they sha^^ drink; what Lord do ye blaspheme, but your own Lord? Such as have had the fear of God before their eyes shal enter inro Gardens, where the trees are covered with branches and leaves, adorned with Rivers and Fountains, with abundance of all sorts of fruits; what Lord do ye blaspheme, but your own Lord? They shall repose upon fair beds, lined with Crimson; what Lord do ye blaspheme, but your own Lord? They shall gather th^ fruits of this garden, to their contentment; what Lord do ye blaspheme but your own Lord? They shall there have wives, who shall not cast a look, but upon them, and whom no person, man, or Angel shall touch before them; what Lord do ye blaspheme, but your Lord? They shall resemble Corrall and Rubies; what Lord do ye blaspheme, but your  own Lord? good deedes are recompensed with good deeds; what Lord do ye blaspheme, but your own Lord? There be yet other gardens, wherein are herbs exceeding green, Rivers; Dates, Pomegranets, and all sorts of fruits; what Lord do ye blaspheme, but your own Lord? There be in these gardens women, who have eyes exceeding black, and bodies exceeding white, they are covered with pavillions, and none, either men or angels shall touch them before their husbands; what Lord do ye blaspeme, but your own Lord? They shal repose upon green Carpets, near rivolets, bordered with flowers; what Lord do ye blaspheme, but your own Lord? Praised be the name of God thy Lord, honour and glory are due to him eternally.   CHAP. LVI The Chapter of Judgment, containing fourscore and nineteen Verses written at Medina. IN the name of God, gracious and merciful. The day of Iudgment will come, none can deny it. That day shall many be afflicted and humbled, and many shal be elated, and rejoyced; the Earth shall tremble, the Mountain open, and be dispersed like dust carryed away by the wind, ye shal be present at that day in a threefold manner These are the Blessed. Some shall have in their right hand the book, wherein shall be written all their actions These are the Damned. Others shall have it in their left hand, and The prop^e^s* such as preceeded them in wel-doing, shal be the nearest to his divine Majesty, and the higher in Paradise, there shal be a great number of the first ages, and few of the latter; they shall repose upon beds, adorned with gold, and precious stones, they shall look upon each other; young boyes shall go about them with vessels, Cups, and Goblets, full of delicious drink, that shall not offend ^he head, neither intoxicate them; they shall have all the fruits that they can covet, and such vy^nds as they shall desire; they sha^ have w^m^n with black eyes, and who shall be white as polished pearls,  for recompense of their good works; they shall not hear an evill word spoken, they shall not sin, and shall hear perpetually the voyce of them that bless them; They that shall hold their book in their right hand, shall be near an Apple-tree, fresh and without throne, and near the tree of Muse is a fruit common in Egypt. Muse under a pleasant shaddow, by flowing water, with store of fruits, of all seasons; they shall use [them] with freedom, lying on delicious beds. We have created the daughters of Paradise Virgins, and affectionate to their husbands, for the content of them that shall have in their right hands, the book of the accompt of their actions, and of many of those that were in the first Ages; and of many of such as shall be in the latter: Those that shall have their book of accompt in the left hand, shall be tormented with an exceeding hot winde, they shall drink boyling water, they shall be in a black, hot, and salt smoak, for that they were Luxurious in the world, for that they were negligent to observe the Commandments of God, and continued in the enormity of their sins. The Infidels say, what! after death we shall be earth, and dust, and shall we rise again with our fathers and predecessors? Say unto them, you, your Predecessors, and posterity, shall all be assembled before God to be judged; Then, oh wicked Imposters! shall ye eat of the fruit of the Tree Zacon is the tree of Hel. Zacon; ye shall fill your belly; ye shall drink boyling water, and be daily altered; behold your condition at the day of Iudgment. We created all of you; if ye believe it not,See Gelaldin. consider the wealth ye possesse, did you your selves create it? We have appointed that ye shall dye; we can if we please, put other creatures like unto you in your place, and metamorphize you into another forme; which ye know not; we caused the soule to enter into the body; if ye consider not this, think upon your tillage; do ye make the earth to bring forth fruits? or do I cause them to spring forth? If I will, I can render your fields drie as straw, without grain, neverthelesse are ye proud; Ye say, what! shall cut grain that we have sown be lost? No, we will preserve it; Consider the water that ye drink, have ye made it to fal from the clouds? or did we cause it to descend? if we  please, we can render it so salt, that ye shall not be able to drink it, if ye acknowledg not this grace, consider the fire that ye kindle; did ye create the wood that burneth? Wee created it, to put you in mind of the fire of hell, and for the profit of the people. Exalt the name of God most mighty. I swear by him that maketh the Stars to fall, (this is a great oath, if ye understand it,) that the Alcoran is a book worthy of praise, all therein is written in good order, no person shal handle it, that is not clean and purifyed; it is sent from God, Lord of the Vniverse; if ye renounce what is written in this book, ye shall be in the number of Infidels, and shall know the truth, when the soul shall forsake your body; I know this better then you, but ye do not consider it; if ye believe not to rise again, cause your soul to return into your body, when it shall be upon your lipps; when a righteous man dyeth, he shall finde rest, and all manner of concentment in the delights of Paradise, if he be of them that hold the book of the accompt of their work in the right hand, and shall be free from eternall pains: If he be in the number of Infidels, and seduced, he shall be precipitated into hell; this is is a most certain truth, Exalt the name of thy Lord omnipotent.   CHAP LVII. The Chapter of Iron, containing twenty nine verses, written at Medina. IN the name of God, gracious and merciful. All that is in the Heavens and Earth, exalteth the glory of God, he is omnipotent and wise; the Kingdom of the Heavens and earth is his, he giveth life and death to whom he pleaseth, he is without beginning, and without end, he knoweth al that me^ make manifest, and whatsoever they keep secret, he knoweth all things. He it is that created the earth, and the heavens in 6 days, and fitteth on his throne, he knoweth whatsoever  ^reth into the earth, and all that cometh out, he knoweth ^^atsoever descendeth from heaven, and whatsoever ascen^h, he is with you in whatsoever place ye are, and seeth (...) your actions; the Kingdom of the heavens and earth ^ his, and all things obey him; He maketh the night to ^ter the day, and knoweth what is in the heart of men. ^elieve in God, and his Prophet, expend in pious works ^^me part of the wealth that he hath given you, he shal ^ive you more. Do good abundantly to them that believe (...) his Law; wherefore will ye not believe in God, and his Apostle, who teacheth you the Commandments of your word? Ye have promised him to embrace his Law; he hath ^nspired his Commandments into his servant, to bring ^ou out of darknesse, and guide you into light, he is graci^us and mercifull. Who hindreth you to make any ex^ence for his glory. The inheritance of the heavens and earth is his; Such as for his service have expended any thing before the taking of Mecca, are not equall in merit to them that fought to conquer that City; they are far above them that fought not, and shall be protected of his divine Majesty; he promiseth Paradise to the righteous, and ^^oweth all your actions. Who is he that shall lend to him any alms? he shall encrease his substance, and give a great reward: Be thou mindfull of the day, when thou ^halt see those men and women that have obeyed my Commandments, with a light, that shall goe before them, it shall be said to them, this day it is declared to you, that you ^hall enter into, and dwell eternally in Gardens, wherein ^^ow many Rivers, and where ye shall finde supreme felicity. Be thou mindful of the day that the wicked shall say to the True-believers, Behold us, cast your eye to our side, that we may partake a little of your light. They shall say unto ^hem, return upon your steps to demand light. There is a place, betwixt them, that hath a secret gate, full of grace, and repose for the righteous, and without environed with misery for the wicked; they shall call upon the righteous, and say, were not we of your RELIGION? they shall reply, yes, but ye betrayed your soules, through disobedience, ye d^ubt^d of the LAW  Law of God, your blasphemie, rendred you insolent, (...) the hour of your death; the Devill made you proud, and moved you to rise against the Commandments of his div^^^ Majesty; this day there is neither ransome, nor favour f^^ you; the fire of Hell is the habitation of the wicked. O^ what an habitation! Such as believe in God think it no trouble to humble their hearts at the remembrance of the Alcoran, and the truth that it containeth; they are not like them that heretofore ha^ the knowledg of the written Law, they have been a long time without Prophets, their hearts are hardned and the greatest part of them have been impious, Know, that God restoreth life to the Earth after the death thereof we have taught you the misteries of faith, peradventure ye will comprehend them; God shall multiply the benefits that the righteous shall lend to him, and shall return them a great reward; Such as believe in God and his Prophet, are righteous; Martyrs shall be recompensed of God, they shall be covered with light, and the wicked that disobey his Commandments shall be damned eternally; the life of this world is but vanity, sport, and delusion; it is but pride; the abundance of wealth and children is like to the rain, the wicked wonder at the plants that it produceth; in the end they wither, become yellow, and then are altogether drie; The impious shall suffer great torments, and the good shall enjoy the mercy of God; the life of this world is but matter of pride, implore pardon of God; Paradise large as heaven and Earth, is prepared for them that shall believe in his divine Majesty, and his Prophet, th^s is an immense grace, which he conferreth on whom he pleaseth. All the evill that ye suffer on earth, in your goods and persons, is written in a Book before i^ befall you; it is an easie thing to God; to the end th^t ye affl^ct no^ your selves extraordinar^ly in your dis^leasures, and that ye rejoyce not overmuch in your contentme^ts; God loveth not the proud, he hath not to do with the covetous, who recommend avarice to the peopl; and who neglect their duty. Praise is due to him, praise is due to him in all places; Certainly we sent our Messengers with our Commandments, we sent with them their Scriptures, and  ^lance, that the people might weigh with good weights. (...) gave iron to men, it causeth great evils, and great good (...) the world, God knowath them that fight with zeal for (...) Law and his Prophet, without seeing him, he is strong (...) omnipotent. We sent Noah and Abraham to instruct (...) people; we instructed their progeny in the Scripture; (...) followed the right way, and many disobeyed our com^^ndments; We sent after them our Prophets and Apostls; (...) sent Iesus the son of Mary, we taught him the G^spel; (...) put civility, clemency, and chastity into the hearts of ^^m that followed him; we did not command them to ^p virginity, they kept it of their own accord, because of ^is desire they had to please God; they have not obser^ed their Law as they ought, many have been disobedient, ^we have rewarded those among them that believed. O (...) that believe in Iesus! fear God, and believe in his pro^^^, ye shall have double ^he reward of Gods mercy, he shal ^^don your sins, he is gracious and mercifull; I teach you ^^se things, to the end that such as have heretofore receved ^^e written Law, may know that they have no power over (...) grace of God, he giveth it to whom he lifteth, certainly ^ is immense,   CHAP. LVIII. ^he Chapter of the Dispute, containing twenty two Verses written at Medina. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. God hath heard the speech of her that disputed with thee, concerning the action of her husband; she exhibited to him ^er complaints, he heareth all your discourses, he heareth and ^eeth all. No person among you shall swear never to ^^uch his Wife no more then his Mother; your wives ^^e not your mothers; your Mothers are those that conceived and brought you forth; they that speake (...) that maner, speak uncivilly, but God is gracious,  and merciful. He that shall have sworn to touch no mo^^ his wife, and shall desire (afterwards) to know her, sha^ give liberty to a slave, for satisfaction of his oath, befor^ he touch her; this is commanded you, God knoweth (...) your actions: if he have not the power to free a slave, he shal fast two moneths together, before touching her; if he cannot fast, he shal give to fifty poor: Thus ought ye to do, if ye believe in God and his Prophet, God so appointed it, and hath prepared great torments for them t^^^ transgresse his Commandments. They that shall disobey him and the Prophet, shall be cove^ed with shame and ignominy, as were their predecessors in impiety; God hath sent his Commandments on earth, those who shal reject them, shall be severely tormented at the day that he shall revive them, he shal declare to them all that they have don, he hath kept accompt, and they have forgotten it, he seeth all. Seest thou not that all that is in the heaven and earth is Gods? If ye be three secretly met together, he is the four^h; if ye be five, he is the sixth; if ye be more or less, he is alwayes with you whresoever you are. He shal relate to men at the day of judgment all that they have don, he knoweth al things. Seest thou not the actions of them to whom private meetings were prohibited? they return to their sin, and do what was forbidden them; they assemble secretly with malice to conspire against thee, and to di^obey thee; and when they come towards thee, they say, that thou hast spoken things that God hath not inspired thee to utter, they know in their soules that God will chastise them for their discourse, and that they all shal go into hel, where their Rendezvous is: Oh ye that believe! make no private meetings to offend God, to conspire against his prophet, and to disobey him; assemble ye to perform acts of vertue, and to serve God, hare his fear before your eyes, ye shal one day appear before his divine Majesty to be judged. Private assemblies proceed from the Devil, for the affliction of the righteous; he bringeth no evil upon them, but through Gods permission; and all believers ought to resign themselves to his divine Will. O ye that believe! when ye shall be assembled with your prophet, and are entreated to  inlarge your selves, in^arge ye your selves, God shal inlarge to you his grace. When ye are bid to rise, rise, Go^ shal raise up all the true-b^lievers that are among you, and p^ace the learned some degrees above others, he knoweth your actions. O ye that believe! when ye shall be disposed to deliver any secret to the Prophet, speak to him with truth, good shall ^efall you, and [he] shall purifie you: if ye fear to impart to him ^our secret, God will not give you his grac^. Make your prayers at the time appointed, ^^^tribute tithes, ob^y God and his Prophet. God knoweth what ye do: Seest thou not them that have abandoned his law? the wrath of his divine Majesty is faln upon them, they are of different opinion in their lye, and know not that they lye, but he hath prepared for them a great punishment, because of their blasphemies; they have concealed their falth, and are ^educed; Certainly he hath prepared for them grievous pains, their wealth and their children shall not be able to deliver them from his indignation, they shall be precipitated into the fire of hell, where they shall abide eternally. B^ thou mindful of the day, when he will cause them to revive; they shall swear as they swear before thee, that they believed in his Law; they affirm they do good, and are lyars, the devill hath prepossessed them, and hath made them forget the word of God; such as follow him are damned. They that transgresse the wil of God, and that of his Prophet, are overcome of the devil: God hath said in the Scriptures, thou shalt not obtain victory over me, neither over my Prophet, he is omnipotent, and alway victorious; thou shalt find none of them that believe in his Law, and the day of judgment, that doth not ex^ctly observe the Commandments of his divine Majesty, and those of his Prophet, although their fathers; their Children, their brethren, and companions oppose them. God hath imprinted faith in their hearts, he hath strengthned them through his Spirit, and shall cause them to enter into ga^dens, wherein flow many rivers, where they shall abide eternally: he shall be satisfyed with their obedience, and they shall be content with his grace. Such as shall obey his Commandments shall be happy.    CHAP-LIX. The Chapter of Exile, containeng twenty foure Verses, written at Medina. IN the name of God; gracious and mercifull: Whatsoever is in the heavens and earth, exalteth the glory of God, he is omnipotent and wise; he it is that hath exiled the wicked from among them that have knowledg of the written Law; when he the first time exiled them, ye believed not that they should depart from their houses; ye believed that their cittadels would defend them from his punishment, but he surprized them, and did cast terrour into their hearts, and they destroyed their dwelling places with their own hands, to assist the true-believers. O ye that are wise! consider their end. If God had not appointed them to quit their Country, he had chastised them in some other maner; they in the end shall suff^r the pains of hell fire, because they have disobeyed his Commandments, and his Prophet; he that shall disobey him, shall be severely chastised: ye cut not Palm trees, and leave none standing, but through Gods permission; he covereth with shame and infamy them that disobey him.See Kitab el tenior. He commandeth you to give to the Poophet* a part of the spoyl that ye shall gaine from your enemies, as well of Horses and Camels, as of other spoils; he endueth him with power and authority over whom he pleaseth, he is omnipotent. He enjoyneth you to give to the Prophet a part of what ye shall conquer over them of the City of Mecca; he commandeth what pleaseth him. Give a share to God, to the Prophet, his Parents, Orphans, the poor, and pilgrims, that no disorder may arise among you that are rich; perform what the Prophet shall command you, abstain from what he shall prohibit you, and fear God, he is severe in his chastisements: do good to the poor, that have forsaken their faculties and ho^ses, and separated themselves from the wicked, for the service of God, and to defend his Law and his Prophet. The^ that before them forsooke their Houses for the service of GOD, affect those that have followed  them, they beare them no malice for the wealth they possesse, although they themselves are necessitous. They that are not avaritious, shall be happy; such as shall suceed them, shall pray for them, and say, Lord, pardon our sins, and our brethren, that were our predecessors in the observance of thy Commandements; infuse no malice into our hearts against them that follow thy Law, thou art gracious and mercifull: Seest thou not, that the wicked say to their brethren, wicked as themselves, had ye not so soon left Medina, we had gone out with you, and had never obeyed him whom ye have obeyed; had ye fought, we had defended you; God seeth that they are impious; had they delayed to goe forth, they should not have gone forth with them; had they fought, they would not have succoured them, they had turned the back, and had found no protection; they feare men more then God, because they are ignorant. [The Jews] shall not fight against you together, unlesse in their fortresses, and behind walls; the War among them is cruell, but think not that they may assemble and unite themselves, their hearts are divided because they are ignorant, they are like their predecessors who were chastised and slain, and shall suffer great torments at the day of Judgement; they are like to him whom the devill had seduced, and said to him, I am innocent of thine impiety, I feare God, Lord of the Universe; the end of both is to be cast headlong into the fire of hell, where they shall abide eternally, such is the reward of the wicked. O ye that believe! feare ^od, and consider what ye shall do at the day of Judgement; feare God, he knoweth whatsoever ye doe; be not like to those that forget his Commandements, he forgetteth them, and they continue in the number of the damned, they shall be most miserable; and such as shall go into Paradise shall be blessed. If w^ should make the Alcoran to descend upon a mountain, it will open it self, with the feare it will have of the Word of God. Thus doe I speak in parables to the people, peradventure they will be converted. There is but one only God, who knoweth what is present, future, and past, he is gracious and merciful; there is but one God, King of  all things: He is holy, the deliverer, true, the punisher, strong, powerfull, glorious. Praised be God, he hath no companion, he is God the Creator, who hath formed whatsoever is in the world, all glorious attributes are due to him; whatsoever is in heaven and earth, exalt his glory, he is omnipotent and wise.   CHAP. LX. The Chapter of Triall, containing eighteene Verses, written at Mecca.  Some Mahometan Doctors have intituled this the Chapter of Vocation, because it entreateth of women that forsooke their husbands, to follow the Law of Mahomet, who appointed to try their hearts, intention, and to know their Vocation.  IN the name of God gracious and mercifull. O ye that believe! obey not mine, nor your enemies; ye shew kindnesse to them when ye meet them; neverthelesse they reject the truth that hath been sent unto them, and chase away the Prophet and you also, and that, because ye believe in God your Lord; Seek not their friendship; when ye fight against them for my Law, I know what ye ought to feare, and ye know it not; he that shall doe what is here above prohibited, followeth an evill way; if they have advantage over you, they will be your enemies, they will stretch forth their hands and tongues against you, they will revile you, and desire that ye may renounce your faith; if ye doe it, ye shall have no content in your wives or children at the day of judgement, ye shall be separated from them, and God shall behold all your actions: ye have a fair example in Abraham and them that were with him, when they said to the people, we are innocent of the sin that ye commit, in worshipping any other God but God; Abraham said to his father, I will ^ot implore pardon of God for thee, I am not able to deliver thee from his punishment, if thou art an Idolater; Lord,  all our confidence is in thee, our refuge is in thy mercy; protect not unbelievers against us, pardon our sins, thou art mercifull and wise; ye have in them a faire example for them that feare God, and apprehend the day of Judgement. God hath not to doe with them that obey Infidels, neither hath he need of any person, and praise is due to him in all places; peradventure he will establish for the future great amity between you and them that ye hate, he is omnipotent, gracious, and mercifull; he doth prohibite you the conversation of them that fight not against you for his faith, and that expel you not from your houses, he doth not forbid you to do them justice, he loveth the just; He forbiddeth you to converse with them that fight against your faith; that drive you from your houses, and aide to expell you; he prohibiteth you to obey them, and to contract amity with them; such as obey them, shall be exceedingly too blame. O ye that beleeve in God! when the wives of your enemies shall throw themselves into your party, trie their conscience; if ye know them to be faithfull, and to believe in the Law of God, restore them not to the incredulous Infidels, it is not lawfull for them to know them, neither for the women to teach them; give them subsistance, ye shall not sin in espousing them: marry them not after the laws of unbelievers; demand of them what dowry they require, they shall demand of you what ye are willing to bestow on them; continue in accord, God so commandeth, he shall be your Judge at the day of Judgement, he knoweth all your actions, and is most wise. If your wives revolt to the party of unbelievers, and ye suffer any damage, ye shall repaire that damage to him that suffereth, out of the booty that ye shall conquer; feare God, and believe in the Law of his divine Majesty. O Prophet! when women shall desire to embrace thy Religion, with firm purpose to believe in one only God, not to steal, neither to commit adultery, neither to murther their children, to lye, blaspheme, or be disobedient, receive them, implore pardon of God for them, he is gracious and mercifull. O ye that believe! obey not them against whom God is angry, they despaire of their salvation,  as the wicked dispaired, that died heretofore in their impiety.   CHAP. LXI. The Chapter of Array, containing fourteen Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. Praise God all that is in heaven and earth, he is omnipotent and wise. O ye that believe! say not that ye doe that which ye doe not, God abhorreth them that say they doe what they doe not, and loveth them that fight in rank and file for his Law, like to a strong wall. Remember thou that Moses said to his people, ye shall doe me no harme, ye shall know in the end that I am the Messenger of God; but God seduced them from the right way, when they departed from obedience to his Commandements, he guideth not the wicked. Remember thou that Jesus, the son of Mary, said to the children of Israel, I am the Messenger of God, he hath sent me to confirm the old Testament, and to declare to you that there shall come a Prophet after me, whose name shall be Mahomet. When he came with miracles, reasons most intelligible, and arguments infallible, they said that he was a Magician; who is more impious then he that blasphemeth against God? The Infidels would extinguish with their mouth the light of faith, but God shall make it manifest against their will; he hath sent his Prophet to guide the people into the way of salvation, to teach them the truth of his Law, and make it more evident then all other Laws of the world, against the will of Infidels. O ye that believe! Will ye that I teach you one thing, that shall deliver you from the pains of hell? Believe in God, and in his Prophet; imploy your wealth and persons in fighting for his Law; ye shall do exceeding well, if ye have knowledge to understand it, God shall pardon your offences, he shall cause you to en^er into gardens, wherein flow many rivers; he shall cause  you to goe into the beautifull Palaces of Eden, where is supreme felicity; he shall confer upon you yet another grace, which ye desire, viz: victory over your enemies. O ye that believe! maintain the Law of God; Jesus, the Son of Mary, said to his Apostles, who will maintain the Law of God with me? he shall be supported, and protected of God. The Apostles answered, we will maintain it; One part of the Children of Israel believed in Jesus, and another rejected his Law; we gave succor to them that believed against their enemies, and they were victorious.   CHAP. LXII. The Chapter of the Assembly, containing eleven Verses, written at Medina. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. Praise God all that is in heaven and earth, praise the King, holy, majestique, and omnipotent, who hath sent his Prophet, an Arabian by Nation, to preach his Commandements to the Arabians, to purifie them, to teach them the Scriptures, and mysteries of faith, they were before seduced from the right way. They that shall come after them, shall not see a Prophet equall to him, this is a speciall grace of God, the omnipotent and wise; he conferreth it on whom he listeth, and his graces are immense. They that preach the old Testament and performe not what it enjoyneth, are like to an Asse charged with books; Such are they that disobey the Commandements of God; he guideth not the impious. Oh ye Jews! believe not your selves to be the beloved of God, expect death, ye shall understand your error; they believe not that they shall be chastised for their sins, but God beholdeth all the unjust: Say unto them, ye shall find one day the death that ye flie; ye be sent back before God, who knoweth what is present past, and to come; he shall set before you all that ye have done, to be judged. Oh ye that believe! when yee are called to the assembly of  Friday, to make your prayers, pray, and quit your trade, this shall be a good act, it ye understand it; when you shal have finished your prayers, separate your selves, goe whither you please, and b^g of God his grace, call frequently to mind his divine Majesty, and ye shall be happy. When the Infidels saw any thing of profit, or any divertisement, they forsook thee, and went out from the Sermon; Say unto them, how great riches and delights are there with God? he is the Rich of the rich.   CHAP. LXIII. The Chapter of the wicked, containing twelve Verses, written at Medina. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. When the wicked shall come to visit thee, they will say, that they are witnesses, that thou art a Prophet sent from God; He well knoweth that thou art his Prophet, he seeth that they dissemble, and fell their faith to enjoy wealth in the world, wherein they commit evill, they say with the mouth, we believe in the Law of God, and are impious in their fouls, impiety is imprinted in their hearts, and they will not learne the mysteries of faith; The beauty of their bodies shall not displease thee, when thou shalt see them; they erect themselves when they speak, and resemble a piece of wood set up against a wall; they feare all rumors that flie abroad, and are your enemies. Beware of them, doubtlesse God will destroy them; how can they blaspheme against his Law? When it was said to them, Come to the Prophet, he shall beg pardon of God for your sins, they shook the head, and withdrew with pride; misery is upon them; whether thou implore pardon for them, or dost not implore it, God will not pardon them, he abhorreth the wicked. They say, doe no good to them that follow that Prophet of God, untill they abandon him; the treasures of heaven and earth are Gods, but they comprehend it not; They say, if we returne to the City of Medina, we will drive thence shame and infamie,  and will there establish greatnesse and honour; on the contrary, greatnesse, power, and victory proceed from God, his Prophet, and them that believe in his Law, but Infidels understand it not. Oh ye that believe in God! your riches and your children ought not to seduce you from his service; such as shall forsake it, shall be in the number of the damned; give alms of the wealth that he hath given you, before the houre of your death arrive; Then shall the wicked say, Lord, if thou hadst not so soon caused me to die, I had embraced thy Law; God retardeth not the day of any one, when the hour is come; he knoweth all that ye do.   CHAP. LXIV. The Chapter of Deceipt, containing eighteen Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious, and mercifull. Praise God whatsoever is in heaven and earth, he is King of all things, praise is due to him, he is omnipotent; He it is that hath created you; Some observe his Commandements, and others are unbelievers, he beholdeth all your actions. He created the heavens and the earth, he formed you, and ye shall be one day assembled before him to be judged; he knoweth all that is in heaven and earth, he understandeth your secrets, and what ye publish, he is not ignorant of what is in the hearts of men. Have ye not heard what did heretofore befall the wicked? They were punished, they dyed in their misery, and in the end shall suffer grievous torments, because God hath sent them Prophets to instruct them, and they said, what! shall a man like our selves teach us the right way? They despised them, and forsook the Law of God; he hath not to doe with them, neither hath he need of the world, praise is due to him in all places; doe the wicked believe that they shall not rise againe? Contrariwise, God shall make them to revive, and shall declare to them all that they  have done; this thing is easie to his divine Majesty; Believe in God, his Prophet, and the light that he hath sent you, he knoweth all your actions. Remember thou the day, when he shall summon all to Judgement, this shall be the day of D^ceipt; they shall be known that have deceived themselves, and those that have deluded their neighbours.See Kitab el tenoir. That day their sins shall be pardoned, that shall have believed in his unity, and have done good works, they shall dwell eternally in Gardens, wherein flow many Rivers: the Infidels that despise his Commandements shall be precipitated into hell, where they shall burn eternally. No evill befalleth you, but through Gods permission; he giveth patience to him that believeth in his divine Majesty, and knoweth all. Obey God and his Prophet; if ye obey him not, know, that the Prophet of God is obliged only to preach the truth of faith; there is but one God, all True-believers resigne themselves to his divine will. Oh ye that believe! ye have children, and wives, that are your enemies, beware of their malice, if ye pardon them; if ye depart from them, God shall be to you gracious and mercifull. Wealth, and children do often hinder you to obey God; but know, that he rewardeth abundantly the righteous; feare him with all your power, hearken to his Commandements, obey him, give alms, he that is not avaricious shall be blessed; if ye lend any thing to God, he shall cause it to multiply, he shall pardon your sins, he accepteth the acknowledgement of his benefits, and is most mercifull* he knoweth what is present, past, and future is omnipotent and wise.    CHAP. LXV. The Chapter of Divorce, containing eighteen Verses, written at Mecca. IN the Name of God, gracious and merciful. O Prophet! when ye repudiate your wives, repudiate them, following the Ordinances and Laws, and reckon the time that they ought to tarry before they marry again; Fear God your Lord, cause them not to depart their houses, neither expell them before the time appointed, if they be not taken in adultery; Such are the Ordinances of God, he that shall transgress them, shall do injury to himself, peradventure God will enjoyn something concerning them, of which ye are ignorant. When the time that they ought to tarrie shall be finished, retain, or dismisse them with civility; ye shall take persons of your Religion, honest men, that shall be witnesses of your actions, depose with truth what ye have seen; it is so appointed to them that believe in God, and the day of Judgement. God shall deliver from affliction him that shall have his fear before his eyes, and shall enrich him* when he least thinks of it; He that shall trust in him, shall not be deceived, he doth what he pleaseth, and hath appointed a prefixed time to every thing. If the women hope no more to have their moneths, and doubt that they are misreckoned, they shall tarrie three moneths, before they marry again, if they be not Nurses; if they be with child, ye shall abstain till their delivery; whosoever feareth God, rejoyceth in the observance of his Commandements. What is above, is ordained of God; he shall pardon their sins, that have his fear before their eyes, and give them an exceeding great reward. Cause them that ye repudiate, to dwell in your houses, or neer to you, abuse them not; If they bee with ch^lde allow them what shall be necessary for them, untill they shall be delivered; if they desire to nurse their children, ye shall give them an honest salarie, and entreat them with civility and curtesie; if ye like not this, ye shall cause them to be nursed by another, whose pains ye  shall reward. If ye be not wealthy, you shall allow according to your power; God doth not enjoyn any one to expend more then his ability permitteth, he shall give you good after evill; how many have been the Cities that have heretofore disobeyed the Commandements of God, and of his Prophets? We have kept an exact accompt of their sins, their Inhabitants have been chastised, and shall be in the end, in the number of the damned; God hath prepared for them grievous torments. Oh ye that are wise! fear God, he hath sent you the Alcoran; he hath sent you a Prophet, to teach you the mysteries of his Law, to lead you out of darkness, and to guide into light them that shall believe in him, and do good works: he shall open to them the Gate of Paradise, wherein flow many Rivers, where they shall dwell eternally, with all manner of content. God! He it is, that created the seven heavens, and as much of earth, and ordaineth among them what pleaseth him, to the end ye may know that he is omnipotent, and knoweth all things.   CHAP. LXVI. The Chapter of Prohibition, containing twelve Verses, written at Medina. IN the Name of God; gracious and mercifull. Oh Prophet! prohibit not for the contentment of thy wives, to do that which God hath permitted thee, he is gracious and mercifull; he hath appointed to do what is permitted by your Law, he is your Lord, is omniscient and most wise. When the Prophet went to visit one of his wives, God revealed to him, what she desired to say to him, he approved one part, and rejected the other; when he told his wife what was in her will to speak to him, she demanded of him, who had revealed it to him; He that knoweth all things hath revealed it to me, that ye may be converted, your hearts are inclined to do what is forbidden; if ye act any thing against the Prophet, know, that God is his  protector, the Angel Gabriel, and all the believers will defend him, the Angels shall protect him against you. If it be his will to repudiate you, God shall give him for the future, other wives in your place, that shall be obedient; True believers, humble, faithfull, devout, contented, milde, clean, virgins, and not virgins: Oh ye that believe in God! strenthen your selves, you and your families, in obedience to his Commandements; the Idolaters shall burn in the fire of hell, with their Idols; the Angels deputed to torment them, disobey not God, they execute whatsoever is commanded them. Oh ye that are Infidels! there is no excuse for you, ye shall be chastised after your demerits. Oh ye that believe! turn to God with affection, he shall pardon your sins, and make you to enter into Gardens, wherein flow many rivers; the light of faith shall goe before the Prophet, and them that have followed him; When God shall recompense them, they shall say, Lord, give us thy light, pardon our sins, thou art omnipotent. Oh Prophet! fight against the Infidels, and the wicked, fortifie thy self against them, hell shall be their habitation. God teacheth unbelievers a parable, and saith, the wives of Noah, and the wives of Lot were under the power of my two servants, righteous men; they betrayed them, but did not escape the punishment of their sin. It was said unto them, enter into the fire of hell with them that goe into it. God teacheth them a parable, that follow his Law; Take example by the wife of Pharoah, she prayed to God, and said, Lord build me an house in Paradise, deliver me from Pharoah, from his works, and unjust men. Mary the daughter of Josaphat preserved her virginity; we inspired into her our Spirit, she believed the words of her Lord, and the Scriptures; shee was in the number of them that obey.    CHAP. LXVII. The Chapter of Empire, containing thirty Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God gracious and mercifull. Praised be he to whom belongeth the Empire of the world, who is omnipotent, and hath created life and death, to let you know which is the better; he is omnipotent and mercifull. He hath created seven heavens, one upon another; thou seest nothing of what he hath created, that is not proportioned; raise yet thy sight to heaven, thou shalt not there see any thing defective; behold it twice, or more often, thou shalt not perceive therein any thing vain or imperfect. We have adorned the heaven, and the world with Stars, we expelled thence the Devils, we prepared for them a great fire, and the torments of hell for unbelievers. They shall hear horrible and terrible voyces, that proceed from despair and wrath; when they shall be cast thither headlong* when they shall enter into hell by troups, the Overseer of the torments shall say unto them, had you none on earth that preached to you the pains of hell? yes, shall they reply, they were preached to us, but we traduced our preachers, we said, that God did not command to do what they declared, that they were lyars, and seduced from the right way; Had we heard them, and had we been wise, we should not this day have been in the number of the damned; they shall confess their sins in the bottome of hell. Such as fear God, without seeing him, shall receive pardon of their offences, and an exceeding great reward. Speak secretly, or publiquely, God knoweth whatsoever ye have in your hearts, since the time of your creation, he is blessed and omniscient. He hath established wayes upon the earth, goe on all sides, and live of his good things: ye all shall revive, and be one day assembled before him to be judged. Believe ye that he who is in heaven, cannot render the earth drie and  barren, and cause it to tremble? Believe ye, that hee who is in heaven is not able to send against you an impetuous winde, to destroy you? Ye shall hereafter feel what are the torments of hell. Your predecessors would not believe them, and were chastised for their incredulity. Consider ye not the birds that flie over your heads, how they extend, and shut their wings? nothing supporteth them, but that mercy that beholdeth all things. Who but God shall protect you in your miseries? The Infidels are proud: Who shall enrich you, if God restraineth his grace? neverthelesse ye persevere in your sinnes, and flie the truth; Is he that creepeth on his face, like to him that goeth on his feet in the right way? Say unto them, God hath created you; hee hath given you sight, hearing and sense, but few among you return him thanks for his graces: Say unto them, he created you of earth, and ye shall one day be assembled before him, to render accompt of your actions. The wicked dmaned when the day of Judgement shall be; Say unto them, God knowes, I am sent only to preach to you the pains of hell; Their visages shall become black, when they shall see the punishment of their sinnes approach. It shall be said to them, behold that which ye have demanded with so much impatience! Say unto them, did you see that God destroyed me, and them that were with me? No, he gave us his grace. Who shall deliver the Infidels from the torments of hell? Say unto them, God is mercifull; we believe in him, and we are resigned to the will of his divine Majesty, ye shall know hereafter them that shall be seduced. If the water that watereth your flocks enter under the earth, who shall give you other water, or another Fountain to supply you?    CHAP. LXVIII. The Chapter of the Pen, containing fifty two Verses, written at Mecca.  Bedaoi entituleth this the Chapter of the Letter Noun, n, and saith, that it is as much as to say, whale, or great Fish; Some other Doctors say, that Noun, n, is the name of the Ink, or Table, on which the Angels write the Commandements of God; Others affirm it, to signifie the Ink-horn, but many of the Mahometan Doctors intitle this the Chapter of the Pen.  IN the Name of God, gracious and mercifull. I swear by the Pen, and by all that is written, that thou art not possessed of the Devill; through the grace of thy Lord; thou shalt have an infinite reward; God hath created thee, with a creation high, and most illustrious. Thou shalt hereafter know, and the Infidels likewise shall know one day, them among you that are ignorant. Certainly thy Lord knoweth them that are seduced, and them that follow the right way. Obey not the wicked, they desire thee to be more indulgent towards them, and themselves more milde towards thee; Obey not those infamous lyars, those bablers, sinners, seducers, and wicked persons, full of treasures and children; When the Mysteries of faith are related to them, they say, that they are but fables of antiquitie; we will put upon their noses a mark of shame, and ignominy; we have tryed them, as Gardeners, when they have resolved in the evening to cut off the morning following some fruits of their garden, for their refection, and have not said, if it please God; By night, which they slept, God sent fier into their gardens, that consumed them; in the morning they called [each other] and said, come to put order to your garden, if ye desire to gather the fruits; they believed the poore would enter they ran [to drive them away] and found their fruits black, and their gardens blasted: Then they said,  we are seduced, we are sinners; one of them said that it was requisite to praise God; Then they said, praised be God, we are great sinners; they approached each other, and complained among themselves: They said, misery is upon us; we were in a great error, peradventure God will give us hereafter more then the value of what we have lost, we must beg his grace; thus God chastiseth on earth, whom he pleaseth* but the torments of the other world are much more grievous: They that have his fear before their eyes, shall dwell in gardens full of delights. Shall I intreat the good like the wicked? How can ye judge it? have ye a book, wherein you reade what pleaseth you? have we promised to you any content at the day of Judgement? Shall you have that day what ye have promised to your selves? Ask of them, who will be surety for their belief? will their Idols, and companions be their surety! Let them cause them to come, if they be true: Be thou mindfull of the day when sins shall be detected, and the wicked shall be commanded to worship God, but they shall not be able to behold him, their eyes shall be troubled with fear, and their sight covered with shame. They are enjoyned in the world to worship his divine Majesty, but they refuse to perform it; I will punish them by little and little, when they shall least think of it; I will defer the punishment of their crimes, because my wrath is strong; Dost thou demand of men any recompence for thy preaching? are they charged with any expence? Have they in their power the book, wherein is the future, to write therein what they affirm? Attend the Judgement of thy Lord, and be not like him that was swallowed of the Whale. He invoked his Lord in his affliction; if his Lord had not sent him his grace, he should never have come upon earth; when he repented of his sin, his Lord pardoned, and placed him in the number of the righteous. The unbelievers labour to shake thee through their looks, and that through envie; they affirm, that thou art possessed of the Devill, when they hear thee read the Alcoran; It was not sent but to instruct the world.    CHAP. LXIX. The Chapter of Verification, containing fifty two Verses, written at Mecca.  Ekteri intituleth this the Chapter of Judgement, because that day all shall be verified.  IN the name of God, gracious and merciful. Verification approacheth, Verification approacheth; God hath not told thee in what time shall be the day of Verification; Temod, and Aad would not believe in him that preached to them the day of affliction and sorrow, but Temod was destroyed by an extraordinary noise, and Aad by an impetuous winde that God sent against them seven nights, and eight dayes together; they were overthrown, str^tched out like palms faln upon the earth: did any one among them save himself? Pharoah, and his predecessors, with the Inhabitants of the Cities that were overthrown because of their sins, disobeyed the Prophets and Apostles of God, and were rudely chastised. We preserved you in Noahs Ark, when the waters swelled, to serve for example of our omnipotency to them that saw it, and to such as shall hear it mentioned. Be thou mindfull of the day when the Angell shall sound the Trumpet, when the earth shall lift it selfe up, and the mountains tremble; then what must come to passe, shall come to passe; heaven with weakness shall open, and the Angel that shall bear the throne of God, shall be upon the border of the heaven. Then shall eight Angels present the books, wherein shall be written the sinnes of men, and nothing shall be concealed. Such as shall take in the right hand the book of the accompt of their actions, shall say, wee finde what we believed to be true, we know with certain knowledge the comming of this day, and the felicity of life is in Paradise: It shall be said to them, eat and drink of the good things of Paradise at your pleasure. They that shall take the book of accompt of their actions in their left hand, shall say, would to God that this  book had been lost, I know not what is this accompt; would to God that I had been eternally buried in the earth: the riches, authority, and treasures of the world are to me unprofitable: It shall be said to the devils, take them, binde them, and throw them headlong into hell, put chains seventy cubits long upon their arms, and cast them into fire; they would not believe in the Unity of God the Omnipotent; they have eaten the bread of the poor, they are this day without protection, and want bread, and shall find nothing but the pains of hell prepared for the wicked. I swear, although ye see, and although ye do not see the Alcoran, it is the word of the Prophet, the Apostle of God, it is not the word of a Poet, but few persons will believe it. It is not the word of one that is wicked, but few men remember it; it is sent from God, Lord of the Universe. The Infidels say, oh Prophet! if thou speak, we will not hear thee, thy speech shall not enter into our hearts: Say unto them, there is none among you able to deliver you from the punishment of your crimes; the Alcoran instructeth in the way of salvation them that believe in his divine Majesty; I know that there are lyars among you, whom God shall put into the number of Infidels: the Alcoran is truth it self. Praised be the name of God Omnipotent and Majestique.   CHAP.LXX. The Chapter of the Ascent, containing forty four Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and merciful. Some persons have demanded when shal the day of Judgement be, and in what time the wicked shall be chastised? none but God is able to deliver men from the torments of hell; he is Lord of the way that ascendeth to heaven, the Angels and Spirits shall ascend towards him at the day of Judgement; that day shall seem to the wicked to endure fifty thousand years; expect with patience; the wicked imagine  they are far from that day, but thou shalt see it speedily, that day shall the heaven resemble dissolved mettall; the mountains shall be like to carded wooll, which bendeth downwards; none shall ask his neighbour who he is, and they shall look one upon another; the unbelievers shall desire to redeem themselves from these pains, through the loss of their children, their wives, their brethren, their companions, their neighbours, and the loss of all that is on earth. The flame of fire shall rise upon them, and shall burn the skin of their head; they shall call upon those that are behinde them, that have, like themselves, abandoned the Law of God; and the covetous, that shall have heaped up treasures. Man was created timerous, he is afraid when evill befalleth him, and is arrogant when good hapneth to him; except the believers, who are stable in their faith, that persevere in their prayers, that give alms to the poor that beg, and those that are bashfull, that believe in the day of Judgement, feare the punishment of God, and know none other women but their own, and their slaves, they shall be exempt from affliction at the day of Judgement; those that shall act the contrary, shall be in the number of the unjust. They who effect what they have promised, and preserve faithfully what to them hath been entrusted, who speak the truth in testimony, and who make their prayers at the time appointed, shall be honoured in Paradise. Wherefore is it that the Infidels, who are about thee, cast their eyes to the right hand, and to the left, with pride? do they require to enter into Paradise, and be saved? We have created them as other men. I swear by the Lord of the East and West, that we are able to change them into a people, better then they, and that it is a thing easie for us to perform; leave them in their errors, untill they be come to the day when they are promised to be chastised, and that they shall come out of their sepulchres to repaire to universall Judgement; they shall repair thither terrified, and their sight shall be covered with shame; this is the day that hath been heretofore preached to them.    CHAP. LXXI. The Chapter of Noah, containing twenty eight Verses, written at Mecca. IN the Name of God, gracious and mercifull. Before men were chastised, we sent Noah to preach to them the pains of hell; he said unto them, O ye people! I preach to you the pains of hell, worship one only God, and fear him, obey me, he shall pardon your sins, hee deferreth your punishment untill the day appointed, and shall not retard it; when his hour shall be come, did ye know it, ye would be converted. Afterward he said, Lord, I have exhorted this people night and day, but mine exhortations have been very much in vain, they have strengthned themselves in their impiety, and when I preached to them, they put their fingers into their ears, and covered their heads with their garments, that they might not hear; they continue in their impiety, and become proud: I have preached to them publikely, I lifted up my voyce, I have expounded to them the mysteries of thy Law; I said unto them, implore pardon of God, he is most merciful; he shall send you abundance of rain to water the earth* he shall give you store of wealth, and many children; he shall give you gardens embellished with fountains, and rivers; who h^ndreth you to honour God? He it is that hath created you in the condition wherein you are: consider ye not that he hath created seven heavens, the one upon the other? that he created the Moon with her brightness, and the Sun with his light? he hath caused the earth to bring forth all sorts of plants; he will cause you all to return to earth, and to revive; he hath extended it, to the end ye may walk in the wayes thereof, large and spacious. Lord, said, Noah, this people hath disobeyed me, they have followed that which can give them neither prosperity nor profit, but rather a most certain damage; they have conspired against me, and said among themselves, forsake not your gods, forsake not O^^^^oa, Igout, Joac, and Nesar, they erre from the right way; Lord,  adde to their confusion. Then were they drowned because of their sins, they shall be cast headlong into the fire, whence none but God is able to deliver them. Noah said, Lord, leave not a wicked man upon the earth, they will seduce thy creatures from the right way, they will leave children, lyars, and impious like themselves; pardon my sins, pardon the sins of my father, my lineage, and those that shall believe in thy Law, and destroy the unjust.   CHAP. LXXII. The Chapter of Devils, containing twenty eight Verses, written at Mecca.   Some Mahometans intitle this the Chapter of Spirits.   IN the name of God, gracious and merciful. Say to the people, I have received an inspiration, which some devils heard of me when I read the Alcoran, and that they said, we have heard the miraculous Alcoran read, it teacheth the right way; we believe in what it contains; we believe not that God hath companions; we believe there is but one God, we believe not that he hath wives, or children, our ignorant persons blaspheme against his divine Majesty, nevertheless we imagin that they could not do it. There are who require aid of the devils, and augment their confusion, because they say, that God will not cause any to rise again; some devils have said, we have been as high as heaven, and found it furnished with guards and stars, we staied in a place a little distant to hear; there is one star that watcheth them that hearken, and drives them away; we know not if God hateth the men that are upon earth, or if he will teach them the right way; but we are now in the number of them that believe in the unity of his divine Majesty: they sayd, oh ye people! we were before in the way of error; we heretofore believed that God did not operate on earth, but no person, in whatsoever place he be, can avoid obeying his Will; we heard the book read that teacheth the right way;  we believe in what it contains; he that believeth in God, will not fear any misery or injustice: there be of us that are good, and that trust in God; others there are, who are wicked and impious: such as obey the Commandements of God, follow the right way, and the wicked shall be precipitated into the fire of hell. Had the Infidels followed the right way, we had sent them from heaven abundance of rain, and given them our grace, I will try them, and such as shall despise the Alcoran shall be punished. The Temples belong to God, invoke one sole God in the Temples: when his servant riseth, he worshippeth his divine Majesty; it wanted not much, but these d^vils had published the plurality of Deities: Say unto the people, worship God my Lord; I believe in one God, who hath no companion, I can neither guide nor seduce you, but through his permission; If I d^sobey him, none shall be able to save me, and I shall want protection at the day of Judgement. I can do no more for you, then to preach to you his Law; this is the subject of my Embassie: He who shall disobey God and his Prophet, shall be damned, and shall remain eternally in the fire of hell. The wicked shal know such as shall be deprived of succour and protection, when they shall behold the pains prepared for them. Say unto them, I know not whether what is promised to you, shall incontinently happen, or whether God will defer it some time; none knoweth what is to come but God, and those whom he hath elected to be Prophets and Messengers of his Will; he inspireth into them his Commandments, to preach to men; he upholdeth all the actions of men, and keepeth an exact accompt of every thing.    CHAP. LXXIII. The Chapter of the Fearfull, containing twenty Verses, written at Mecca.  The Arabians have intituled this the Chapter of the Fearfull; when the Angel Gabriel brought this Chapter to Mahomet, he was afra^d of the splendor of his light, and covered himself with his garments, which gave occasion to the Angel to call him, and say, oh fearful! and not, oh Prophet! as he was w^nt.  See Gelaldin.IN the Name of God, gracious and mercifull. O thou Fearfull! Arise by night, pray to God at midnight, untill two thrid parts of the night, and more. Read the Alcoran, and meditate thereon, observe what it contains; although it be tendious to thee, thou wilt best comprehend it after thy first sleep, because thou in the day hast affairs that divert thee. Remember thou the name of God, forsake the world to worship him, he is Lord of the West, and East, there is no god but God, take him for thy protector: be not impatient at what the wicked say; separate thy self from their society, without fear, leave me to punish them; is there any one that is able to defend them? their punishment is deferred, but I have chains of iron, bread full of thorns, and great torments to inflict on them, at the day when the earth shall tremble, and the mountains shall be dissolved into dust. O ye people! we have sent to you a Prophet, our Apostle, to instruct you, as we did to Pharoah; he was disobedient and obstinate, and we severely chastised him. How will ye secure your selves from the torments of hell, if ye be in the number of the wicked? What will ye do at the day when Infants shall be men, and heaven shall be opened? What God promiseth is infallible, these things are for the instruction of them that desire to follow the way of salvation. Thy Lord knoweth that thou wilt arise about the third part of the night, or at midnight, as likewise a part of those that are with thee; he reckoneth the hours and the minuts of night and day, he  knoweth that thou canst not reckon them exactly; he pardoneth thee, if thou risest a litle sooner, or a litle later, read during this time what thou shalt be able to read of the Alcoran; God knoweth that there will be persons among you that will be sickly, others that will be in travels for their affairs, and some that will fight for the faith; these persons shall be excused: Read what ye shall be able of the Alcoran, lift up your prayers to God, pay tithes, lend to God some benefit, ye shall one day find the good that you shall have done, and a very good reward; beg pardon of God, he is gracious and mercifull.   CHAP. LXXIV. The Chapter of the Wrapped, containing fifty seven Verses,Mahomet was wrapt in his garments when the Angel brought him this Chapter. written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. O thou wrapped! Arise, and preach to the people the torments of hell, thy Lord is more powerful then the Idols, make clean thy garments, be thou mindfull of the pains prepared for unbelievers; separate thy self from their company; lend nothing to Usury; the day that the Trumpet shall sound, shall be extreamly irksome to the wicked, that day, let me chastise him whom I created, and to whom I gave riches, and children, and whom I placed in plenty, neverthelesse he demandeth more, and is obstinate, to disobey my Commandements; I will adde to his pains, because he blasphemeth against the Alcoran; wherefore doth he blasphem? he maketh his countenace sorrowful, covered with hypocrisie; when he beholdeth the people, with his eyes melancholique, and estranged from the way of salvation, he is proud, scorneth to follow the Prophet; saith, that the Alcoran is but Magick, and but the word of Man; he shall be precipitated into the bottom of hell, nothing remains to him but to be burned; ninteen Spirits shall be appointed to torment the wicked: they that punish the damned are Spirits. We have mentioned this number of nineteen, to seduce the Infidels,  and confirm the truth, and the True-believers in their faith. They whom God instructeth in the Scripture, and who believe in his Law, are not in doubt of these Spirits; but such as have evill in the heart, who doubt of his Law; and the wicked say, that he by this number, meaneth God; Thus God seduceth and guideth whom he pleaseth; no person knoweth the number of his Angels, but God. I swear by the entrance of the night, and the morning, that hell is an exceeding great punishment, prepared for the impious. The believers, and unbelievers, the good and the bad, shall answer for their actions; and such as shall have their book of accompt in the right hand, shall goe into Paradise; they shall enquire of the damned, and say to them, who did cast you into hell They shall answer, we did not pray to God at the time? appointed; we gave not to the poor to eat; we believed there was neither Resurrection, nor Judgement, untill death surprized us, the prayers of them that pray for them, shall be in vain. Wherefore is it that unbelievers depart from the Law of God? They are like to the wilde Asse, which flyeth as far as he can, when he seeth the Lion approach him; every one of them would particularly see a book to instruct them, and apprehendeth not the day of Judgement; Certainly the Alcoran teacheth them the Law of God, that reade it; none shall understand it, but he that shall be pleasing to God; who shall have his fear before his eyes, and shall implore pardon of his sins of his divine Majesty.   CHAP. LXXV. The Chapter of the Resu^rection, containing fourty Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. I swear that it is most true, that men shall rise againe. I swear, that the wicked shall render an accompt of their  actions; think they that I cannot recollect their bones? I will recollect all of them after they shall be corrupted; I am able to recollect their fingers, as they had them in their youth. Certainly man is prone to blaspheme, before the coming of the day of Judgement, and enquireth when that day will be. When his sight shall be troubled, and the Sun and Moon gathered together, then shall he say, whether shall I flye? It shall be said to him, thou shalt have none other refuge but in God; he shall be surprized, and all his offences shall be commemorated to him, and he shall witnesse against himself: Speak not then in a word, if he will excuse himself, be not thou impatient; I know all that is in his heart, I know what thou hast taught him; I did read with him, that read to thee the Alcoran, and made thee to understand it; Man presseth himself to goe to his dishonor, and considereth not his end, he shall raise the head, with a countenance content to see God, but at the same instant shall have the face covered with affliction, and shall know, that he is in the height of all miseries; His soul shall be conducted towards God, when it shall be separate from his body; If it renounce the Law of God, it shall goe towards the damned, towards them that extend their armes through dispaire. It shall be said to him, God alone, whom thou wouldst not obey, was thy Lord and protector. Doth man think to be forsaken, and that no accompt shall be required of his actions? Was not he created through our speciall grace, of mire, and of congealed blood? Did we not create him male, and female? He that hath done this, cannot he revive the dead.   CHAP. LXXVI. The Chapter of Man, containing thirty Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. Man continued a while, without having in him any thing memorable;  We created his posterity of his seed, mingled with that of the woman; we gave him sight and hearing, and taught him the way of Salvation. Some have embraced the faith, and others have been Infidels; we have prepared for them chains, and bonds, to drag them into the fire of hell.See Exteri. The just shall drink of wine, that shall issue out of a faire Fountaine; all the servants of God shall drink [thereof] and shall cause it to flow, as shall seeme good to them. God will deliver from the pains of hell, such as shall satisfie their vowes, as shall apprehend the day of Judgement, as shall give alms to the poore, to orphans, and prisoners, without hope of thanks, or recompense, but only for the love of his divine Majesty, because of the feare they have of the torments of the day, grievous and irksome to behold. God shall rejoyce, and reward them for their good works, he shall open to them the gate of Paradise; they shall be cloathed with silk, reposed on stately beds, and shall not be troubled either with the heat of the Sun, or the cold of the Moon; they shall be under the shadow of the Trees of Paradise, there shall they gather fruits, as they stand, sit, and lie down; Vessels of silver shall be brought about them, and round Cups full of a delicious drink, as much as they shall desire, mingled with ginger, that shall issue out of a clear fountain, and shall be encompassed with young pages to serve them, who shall resemble polished pearls; when thou shalt behold them, thou shalt see a grace that cannot be exprest; they shall be cloathed with purple, and green shining silk, and shall have bracelets of Silver; God shall give them a drink, clear and most pure, these delights shall be the reward of their perseverance. We have sent thee the Alcoran to instruct the people; attend the Judgement of thy Lord against them that scoffe, and obey not the wicked; Remember thou the name of God, morning and evening, worship him by night, praise him a long time; the Infidels affect the world, and think not on their end, neither the day of Judgement; we created them, we have given them strength to walk, and if it be our pleasure, we will establish other persons in their  place. He that shall desire to follow the Law of God, shall ^ollow it; but none shall follow it, if it please his divine Majesty; he knoweth all, and ^s most wise, he giveth his ^race to whom he pleaseth, and hath prepared grievous ^^rments for the unjust.   CHAP. LXXVII. The Chapter of them that are Sent, containing fifty Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. I sweare by the Angels that followed [each other] thick as the hair of the foretop of horses, when God sendeth them to execute his commands; by the Angels which he sendeth to punish them whom he will destroy; by the winds which he sendeth to make the rain to fall where he listeth; by the Alcoran, that distinguisheth good from evill; and by the Angels that inspire into men the fear of the pains of hell, and implore pardon of his divine Majesty, that the punishment promised to the wicked, is infallible. Then shall not the Stars appeare any more; the heaven shall open, the Mountains shall walk, the Prophets and Apostles of God shall assemble, to bear testimony against them that have despised their instructions; the good, and the wicked, the believers and unbelievers shall be separated. I will not tell thee when this day shall be, it shall be unhappy for the wicked. Have not I heretofore destroyed the impious with their blasphemies? Have not they left a posterity, wicked as they, whom I likewise have destroyed? Thus will I hereafter destroy the Infidels, and misery shall be upon them eternally: Have we not created you of weak seed, retained in the wombe of your mothers, untill the time appointed? This is a grace that we have conferred on you; Misery shall be upon the Infidels at the day of Judgement. Have we not created the earth, to assemble the living and the dead? Have wee not raised the Mountaines? Have we not given you fresh water to drink? Misery shall  be upon the wicked at the day of Judgement; It shall be^ said unto them, goe into the fire of hell, which ye would not believe, goe into the smoak, divided into three parts, nothing shall free you from the heat thereof, and flight shall not deliver you from that fire; it shall cast forth black flames, that shall rise higher then the highest buildings of the earth, and like to large coverlets of beds, extremely black. The day of Judgement shall be unhappy to Infidels: It shall be said to them, behold the day of the separation of the good from the bad; exercise your flights, if ye can, to deliver you from the pains of hell; the day of Judgement shall be unhappy to Infidels. The good, who shall have had the feare of God before their eyes, shall be under the shadow of the trees of Paradise, nigh to delicious fountains, with all sorts of fruits, that they shall desire. It shall be said to them, eat, and drinke at your pleasure, in reward of your good works; thus are the righteous rewarded. The day of Judgement shall be unhappy for Infidels. Oh ye Infidels! live in the world, ye shal be there suffered some time; ye are wicked, but ye shall be miserable at the day of Judgement. The wicked deride them that exhort them to pray to God, they shall be miserable at the day of Judgement. In what will they believe, if they believe not in the Alcoran.   CHAP. LXXVIII. The Chapter of News, containing forty Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. What doe the wicked enquire of each other, touching the great news, of which they are in different opinion? They shall learn it, they shall learn it; Have not I created, and extended the earth? have not I raised the Mountains to establish it? Have not we created you, male and female! Have not we created sleep, and the night for repose, and the day of labour? have we not built over you seven heavens,  and the Sun full of light? have we not caused rain descend from the clouds, to cause the earth to produce plants, and gardens of divers fashions? The day of ^dgement shall be a day of joy, and sorrow. When the Angel shall sound the Trumpet, all the world shall come ^troups to universall Judgement; Heaven shall open its ^^es, the Mountains shall walk, and hell is the place ^epared for the seduced, there shall they remain eternal^. They shall find there no rest, neither drink, but of boy^ng, and most stinking water, a reward conformed to their ^orks; the Infidels believe not that they must render an ^ccompt of their actions, and blaspheme, but we keep ^ccompt, and write exactly what they doe. It will be said (...) them at the day of Judgement, Taste this day the punishment that ye have merited, your pains shall be augmented, and pains upon pains. They who shall have had the feare of God before their eyes; shall be in a place of felicity, in the gardens of a most fertile Land, enriched with grapes, and Pomegranats; they shall drink in Cups full of a delicious liquor, and shall hear no vain speeches, nor lying; such is the recompense of them that obey the Commandements of God; He is Lord of the heavens and earth, none shall dare to speak when the Spirits and Angels shall be assembled before him, none shall be able to speak or pray for another, without his permission, This day shall be the day of truth; they that shal be acceptable to him, shall retire towards his divine Majesty. We have preached unto you, that the punishment of God shal speedily come upon you; every one shall see all that he shall have done, and the wicked shall say at the day of Judgment, would to God that I had been earth and dust.    CHAP. LXXIX. The Chapter of them that take away, containing forty six Verses, written at Mecca. Gelaldin entituleth this, the Chapter of them that draw forth the soul.IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. I sweare by the Angels that take away the souls from the bodies of Infidels, and the wicked; By the Angels that accompany the souls of believers; By the Angels that exalt the glory of God: By the Angels that guide the souls of the righteous, when they goe into Paradise, and by the Angels that are appointed for the affairs of the world, that all people shall rise again at the day of Judgement; that day the earth shall tremble, and the hearts of men shall tremble at the first time that the Trumpet shall sound, at the second, their sight shall be troubled with feare, and they shall say, Behold! we, we are returned upon earth, to the place whence we departed; our bones were rotten, and our returne to the world shall bring upon us only misery; this second sound of the Trumpet is a sign of the wrath of God; Then shall they be out of their sepulchers, revived upon the earth. Hast thou learned the history of Moses, and how God his Lord called him in the holy valley, called Tor, and how he said, goe towards Pharoah, he is seduced from the right way, and is in a great error; Say unto him, I called thee to the way of Salvation, I will purifie and guide thee into the way of the Law of God, to the end thou mayst have his fear before thine eyes. Moses made Pharoah to see one of his great miracles, neverthelesse he contemned Moses, disobeyed him, and departed from the right way; he caused his people to assemble, and made Proclamation, that he was their God, but God rigorously chastised him, because of his blasphemies; this is an example of his omnipotency to them that are righteous. O ye wicked! were ye more difficult to create then heaven? God hath raised the roof thereof, and proportioned it; he hath made the night obscure, and the day full of splendor, he hath stretched  forth the earth, hath made fountains to spring forth, to water the plants, and to give drink to beasts; he hath elevated and established the Mountains for you, and for your flocks. Men shall call to mind the good and the evill that they have done, at the second sound of the Trumpet, and hell shall appeare open before their eyes. The wicked, that have followed their own appetites on earth, shall be precipitated into hell, and such as have had the feare of God before their eyes, and have subdued their passions in this world, shall goe into Paradise. The wic^ed will ask of thee, when the day of Judgement shall be? none knoweth it but thy Lord: Thou art not sent but to preach the pains of hell to them that feare that day, as if they saw it present before their eyes; they shall imagine that they have not remained in the tomb, but from evening untill morning, when they rise againe.   CHAP. LXXX. The Chapter of the Blind, containing forty two Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God gracious and mercifull. The Prophet frowned, had a surly countenance, and withdrew himself when the blind came towards him. He will not tell thee, if he will believe in God, and if he will professe thy preaching; depart thou from him that shall depart from the Law of God, thou art obliged only to preach to him, and not to make him to believe; but forsake not them that shall come to see thee to be instructed, and shall fear God. The Alcoran is sent for the instruction of men; it was copied upon the book that is kept in heaven, to which honour and praise is due eternally. Wherefore is man impious? Is it because he is created of a little water, retained in the womb of his mother, untill the time appointed? and because hee found the way to come forth? is it for that God causeth him to dye, and to revive when it seems good to him? Hee performeth nor what God  commandeth, neither considereth the good things that nourish him: We have sent rain, we opened the treasures of the earth, we made all sorts of grain to spring forth; Blites, Olives, Dates, Gardens, and fields full of fruits, and herbs to nourish you, and your flocks. When the Angel shall sound the Trumpet the second time; Man shall flie his brother, his mother, wife, and children; every one shall take thought for himself; that day shall the wicked have countenances covered with affliction; the countenance of the good shall be joyfull, and such as have sought the way between faith and impiety, shall have the countenance covered with earth, and dust.   CHAP. LXXXI. The Chapter of Roundnesse, containing twenty nine Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. When the Roundnesse of the Sun shall appeare, the Stars fall, the Mountains walk, the Camel be without burden, and without keeper; when the beast shall be gathered together, the Sea covered with fire, Souls returne into bodies, The Arabians buried their daughters alive, when they had done a fault. the Daughter demand why they put her to death; when the book of good and evill shall open, when heaven shall cast oft its ornaments, the fire of hell appeare, and Paradise be opened; then shall souls know the good and the evill that they have committed. I sweare by the Planets, by the obscurity of night, and by the brightnesse of day, that the words of the Alcoran are the words of the Prophet, beloved of God, powerfull with his divine Majesty; ye ought to obey him, he is a faithfull observer of what is commanded him, he is not possessed of the Devill, as ye have imagined, he hath seen the Angel clearly, and without riddle, and is not perplexed for what is to come; the words of the Alcoran are not the words of the Devill; on whatsoever side ye turne you, it is only for the instruction of men, and such among you, as will follow the right way,  but ye shall have no inclination to follow it, if it please God, the Lord of the Universe.   CHAP. LXXXII. The Chapter of the opening of Heaven, containing seventeen Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. The souls shall know the good and the evill that they have pone, when the heavens shall open, the starrs fall, the seas be gathered together, and the sepulchres be opened. O man! what maketh thee so proud as to rise against God, who hath created thee, who hath formed and proportioned thee after what manner he pleased? O ye wicked! ye will not believe the day of Judgement: there are Angells that observe your actions, and are obedient to God. The just shall go into Paradise, and the unjust be precipitated into the fire of hell, whence they shall never return. I will not tell when the day of Judgement shall be; that day none shall be able to succour his neighbour, and God alone shall command.   CHAP. LXXXIII. The Chapter of t^e^ that weigh with false weights, containing thirty t^ree Verses, written at Mecca. In the name of God, gracious and merciful. They that weigh with false weigh^s, and measure with false measures, believe not to ris^ again, at the day when all the world shall appear before God to be judged. Certainly the book wherein the sins of the wicked are written, is kept in hell. Misery shall be upon In^^^^lls at the day of Judgement; none doubteth the coming of this day but the wicked: when they hear the Commandments of God preached, they say, that it is but an old fabl^ impiety retaineth them  in this error, and induceth them to abandon the Law of his divine Majesty, but they shall be cast headlong into the flames of hell. It shall be said unto them, behold the punishment which ye would not believe. The book wherein the good works of the righteous are written, is reserved in heaven; the Angells are witnesses, how the just shall enjoy the delights of Paradise, they shall see the immense graces of God, reposed on delicious beds, their countenance shall be covered with joy, and content; they shall drink of purified wine, most savoury, that shall have the odour of Musk, preserved in bottells, that none but themselves shall open, and it shall be mixt with the water of the fountain of Paradise, where the Cherubins do drink. The Infidells deride the true believers that would instruct them, neverthelesse when they return to their companions, they admire their doctrine, and say when they see them, behold the seduced, but they are not sent to be their tutors. The Infidells that shall be converted, and believe in the day of Judgement, shall go into Paradise, they shall enjoy the grace of God, they shall behold the grievous torments of the damned, that shall be punished after their demerits, and shall find in the other world what they have done on earth.   CHAP. LXXXIV. The Chapter of the Cleft, containing twenty five Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. The day of Judgment shall appear, when the heaven shall cleave asunder, and the earth cast men out of their sepulchres by the Commandement of God. O man! thou goest daily towards death, and shalt find in the end the good and evill that thou shalt have done: he to whom shall be given the book of accompt of his actions in the right hand, shall be blessed, he shal go with his companions into Paradise, where he shall enjoy eternall felicity. He to whom shall be given the accompt of his actions in the left hand, shal be damned,  he shall be cast headlong into the fire of hell, because of the unlawfull pleasures that he hath taken in the world, and for that he believed not in the Resurrection: God beholdeth all that he doth, and keepeth accompt. I swear by the rednesse that appeareth in the Air, when the Sun setteth, by the obscurity of the night, and the brightnesse of the Moon, that you all shall change being and posture, and shall revive after your death. Wherefore is it that the wicked believe not in God? why do they not humble themselves when they hear the Alcoran read? they blaspheme against God, but he knows all their actions; declare to them that they shall be chastised, and that such as believe in his Unity, and do good works, shall receive infinite reward.   CHAP. LXXXV. The Chapter of Signs Celestiall, containing twenty Verses, written at Mecca.  Many Mahometane Doctors intitle this the Chapter of Castles.  IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. I swear by heaven, adorned with signs, and by the day of Judgement, by the Angels and men, that they who have made pits filled with fire to burn the true-believers, shall be witnesse of their own malice and shall avouch, that the fire burned themselves, to make them know the unity of God, and the truth of his Law. God is Omnipotent, and always victorious, he is the King of the heavens and earth, he beholdeth all. They that torment true-believers, and shall not repent, shall be damned, they shall burn eternally in the fire of hell; and such as shall believe in God, and do good works, shall dwell in pleasant gardens, wherein flow many rivers, where they shall for ever enjoy supream felicity. The wrath of God is strong, he maketh his creatures to die, and rise again when he pleaseth; he is mercifull towards them that repent of their sins, and loveth them  that serve him. He hath created his throne, to which praise is due eternally; he raiseth up whom he listeth, and nothing is to him impossible. Hast thou heard the history of the people of Pharaoh and Temod? God shall chastise in like manner them that shall not believe in his Law, he knoweth them all. Certainly the precious Alcoran is written in the book that is reserved in heaven.   CHAP. LXXXVI. The Chapter of the Starr, or of the North Star, containing seventeen Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. I swear by Heaven, and the Star that teacheth men the way, I will not tell thee by what star; by the starr full of brightnesse; that every person hath a guardian (which observeth the good and the evill that it acteth;) Doth not man consider of what he is created? he is made of a little sprinkled water that issueth out of the body of man and woman; God shall make him to rise again at the day of Judgment, and none shall be able to protect or defend him from the wrath of his divine Majesty. I swear by heaven that returneth the rain, by the earth that openeth it self, and receiveth it, to produce its fruits, that the Alcoran distinguisheth good from evill, and that it was not sent in vain. The unbelievers conspire against the Prophet, but God shall turn their conspiracie against them, and they shal not know it. Be thou patient and a while endure the Infidels.   CHAP. LXXXVII. The Chapter of the High and Mighty, containing seventeen Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. Exalt the name of thy Lord, high and mighty, who hath  proportioned all that he hath created; he ordaineth what he listeth; and guideth into the right way then that are pleasing to him; he causeth herbs to spring out of the earth, createth them green, rendreth them dry, and altereth them as to him seems good. I will read to thee the Alcoran; forget nothing of what thou shalt read, but that which God shall will thee to forget, he knoweth whatsoever is kept secret in the world, and whatsoever is made manifest. I will instruct thee in his Law; preach the Alcoran, it shall be profitable to him that shall have the feare of God before his eye; such as shall despise it, shall be miserable, they shall be precipitated into the fire of hell, where they shall not be able, either to live, or die; and he that shall embrace the Law of God; and shall be mindfull of his name, shall be blessed. Pray to God at the time appointed. Certainly the righteous shall be heirs of the good things of the earth, and those of heaven that are exceeding great, and eternall; this is written in the antient books of Abraham and Moses.   CHAP. LXXXVIII. Chapter of the Covering, containing twenty six Verses, written at Mecca.  Gelaldin intituleth this, the Chapter of Judgement, because that day the damned shall be covered with fire and fear. See Exteri.  IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. Hast thou heard mention of the covering? That day shal the countenance of the wicked be covered with affliction, they shall enter into fire that is extremely hot; they shall drink of boiling water, they shall eat nothing but bryers and thorns; they shall be extremely lean, and famine shall not deliver them from an infinite number of other miseries. That day shall the good be filled with content, they shall be recompensed for their labours; in Paradise they shall hear nothing spoken that may displease them,  they shall see fountains flow, lying upon high beds, they shal drink in fair glasses, fixed on diamonds, upon pillows well disposed, and upon pallets well adorned; will not the wicked consider the miracle of the she Camell? how it was created? how heaven was elevated? how the mountains were disposed, how the earth was extended? Preach to the wicked the pains of hell, thou art sent to preach to them, and not to constrain them, God will chastise with his great chastisement him that shall abandon his Law, and traduce the Alcoran: All men shall be one day assembled before his divine Majesty, to give accompt of their actions.   CHAP. LXXXIX. The Chapter of the Morning, containing thirty Verses; written at Mecca. IN the name of God,See Kitabel tenoir. Ye shall there see the exposition of this passage. gracious and mercifull. I swear by the Morning, by the tenth night of the moneth, by even and odd, and by the coming of night, that the wicked shall be chastised. Is there any thing in consideration of this oath, that can move men to fly uncleannesse? Considerest thou not how God entreated Aad the Son of Arem, that dwelt in pavillions supported by columns, so big, that there were none like to them in his Countrey? Knowest thou not how he used Temod, who hewed stones and rocks to inhabit the Valley? Knowest thou not how he entreated Pharaoh, who pierced with pins the feet and hands of such as he gave up to punishment? Knowest thou not how he entreated them, that heretofore erred from the right way in their own Countreys, and that increased their pollution? he poured upon them divers torments; he observeth all that men do; he giveth store of goods to them that he doth not try, and taketh them away from such as he proveth. The wicked will not give honour to Orphans, they will not abstain from eating the bread of the poor; they shall give an accompt, they too much affect riches;  when the earth shall tremble, and shall overthrow all the buildings, when the Angels shall descend in order, by the command of thy Lord, then shall hell be open to the wicked, they shall call to mind what was preached to them in the world, and say, why did not I observe the Commandements of God during my life: they shall be punished more then ever any hath been, and shall be more straitly bound then ever any hath been bound. It shall be said to the blessed, O thou soul! that haft observed with courage, and without fear the Commandements of God, return to thy Lord with content, enter into the so^^ry of the blessed, enter into Paradise.   CHAP. XC. The Chapter of the City, containing twenty Verses, written at Mecca.   Many have entituled this, the Chapter of Night.   IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull.Mecca. I swear by that City which is permitted thee to conquer; I swear by the father and the child, that we created man in misery; thinketh he that there is none stronger then he? He saith, that he hath expended great wealth; doth he think that none hath seen what he hath done?He declaims against Corets. See Gelaldin. Have we not given him two eyes, a tongue, two lips? Have we not given him to see the way of good and of evill? he shall be severely chastised, but I will not tell thee with what kind of chastisement. Wherefore doth he not deliver slaves? Wherefore doth he not give to eat to them that are hungry, to Orphans, and his kindred that are in necessity, and to the poor? patience and charity are recommended among true-believers, they shall be seated at the right hand; and such as impugn the Mysteries of our Law, shall be at the left hand, they shall be shut up in the fire of hell.    CHAP. XCI. The Chapter of the Sun, containing fifteen Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. I swear by the Sun, and his light, by the Moon and her splendour, by the fire, and its elevation, by the night, and its obscurity, by Heaven, and the Starres thereof; by the earth, and its plaines, by the creation of the soul, by the knowledge of vertue and vice, that he that shall be purified from his sins, shall be most happy, and that he who defileth himself with vice, shall be most miserable. The people of Temod traduced their Prophet, because of their obstinacy; but certainly they were chastised. The Apostle and Prophet of God said unto them. Behold the Camell of God, suffer it to drink; they derided him, and slew that Camel, God severely punished them, he spared not his chastisement against them.   CHAP. XCII. The Chapter of Night, containing twenty Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. I swear by the obscurity of Night, by the brightnesse of Day, by the creation of man and woman, that your actions are very different. He that shall yeild to God the obedience that is due to him, and believeth in his Unity, shall go into Paradise; and whosoever shall not praise his divine Majesty, and will not be converted, shall go into hell, his riches shall not save him, and he shall be cast headlong into eternall flames. It is we that guide the people, we dispose the beginning and end of every thing; I preach to you the torments of hell, none shall enter there, but the wretches that have blasphemed, and departed far from the way of salvation; he that hath the fear of God before his  eyes, and giveth almes, shall be delivered from the fire of hell, every one shall be recompensed for what he hath done for the love of God; he shall be satisfied and contented.   CHAP. XCIII. The Chapter of the Sun rising, containing ten Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. I sweare by the brightnesse of the rising of the Sun, and by the darknesse of night, that thy Lord hath not forsaken thee. He doth not hate thee, his delay shall be to thee advantage, and in the end thou shalt be content; Did he not well lodge thee, when thou wert an Orphan? Did he not well guide thee, when thou wert seduced? Did not he inrich thee when thou wert poore? Do no injury to Orphans, devoure not the poor, and recount the graces that God hath conferred on thee.   CHAP. XCIV. The Chapter of Joy, containing eight Verses, written at Mecca.Mahomet complains to the Angel Gabriel, because he so long had refrained to visit him. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. Have not I rejoyced thine heart? have not we delivered thee from the burden that was heavy on thy shoulders? we have raised thy name and reputation, affliction is followed of content; when thou shalt have finished thy prayers, labour, and love thy Lord.    CHAP. XCV. The Chapter of the Figge, containing eight Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. I swear by the Figs and Olives by Mount Sinai, and by the safety and freedome that is in this City [of Mecca] that we created man with proportion, afterwards we rendred him contemptible, except the true believers that do good works, they shall receive an infinite reward. After this (o wicked man) what maketh thee to blaspheme against the Faith? is not God the Judge of Judges?   CHAP. XCVI. The Chapter of Blood congealed, containing seventeen Verses, written at Mecca.  Beddaoi and Gelaldin call this the Chapter of Reading.  IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. Read the Alcoran, and begin through the name of God, who created all, who made man of a little congealed blood. Read the Alcoran, and exalt the glory of thy Lord, who hath instructed man in the Scriptures, who taught him what he knew not; neverthelesse, he is in a great error, he will not consider that he shall returne before God. Hast thou considered him that would have hindred one of the servants of God to make his prayers? hast thou understood if he were in the way of salvation? hast thou seen if he blasphemed? if he hath abandoned the faith? knoweth he not that God forsaketh him? If he desist not, he shall be dragged by the hair into the fire of hell, with the wicked; he shall quit the place where they assemble, to dispute against the faith, and the devills shall cast  them head-long into flames eternall. Disobey not the commandements of God, persevere in thy prayers, worship God alwaies; obedience to his commandements shall draw thee neer to his divine Majesty.   CHAP. XCVII. The Chapter of Glory or Power, containing five Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. We sent the Alcoran in the night of Glory and Power, I have not taught thee the graces of this night of glory and vertue; the prayers and good works that are done that night, have more of merit and efficacy, then those that have been performed in a thousand months. The Angels descended that night to the earth, thorow the permission of their Lord, and salute the true believers untill the dawning of the day.   CHAP. XCVIII. The Chapter of Instruction, containing eight Verses, written at Medina. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. They that understand the Scripture, and believe in many gods, will not relinquish their Idolatry, untill they have heard the instruction of the Prophet of God; he shal read unto them a book clean and pure, wherein are written the Precepts of the right way. They that know the Scripture are not divided, untill they have learned this instruction. It commandeth to worship one only God, to make their prayers at the time appointed, and to pay tirbes, this is the right way. The unbelievers that know the Scriptures, and adore many gods, shall remain eternally in the fire of hell, and shal be most miserable. They that believe in one God, and perform good works, shal be most happy.  they shall be recompensed of their Lord in the garden of Eden, wherein flow many rivers, where they shall dwell eternally. God shall be satisfied with their obedience, and shall give them his blessing prepared for them that feare him.   CHAP. XCIX. The Chapter of the Earth-quake, containing eight Verses, written at Medina. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. When the earth shall tremble, and shall cast bodies out of their sepulchres, man shall demand what it will do; they shall tell him news, to wit, that God hath commanded it to do so. That day shall men come out of sepulchres from divers places, and shall see the good and the evill that they have done; he that hath committed evill, of the weight of an atome, shall be chastised; and he that shall have done good, of the weight of an atome, shall be rewarded.   CHAP. C. The Chapter of Horses, containing eleven Verses, written at Mecca and Medina.  Some Arabians have called this the Chapter of Return, or of them that return.  IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. I sweare by the Horses, and the noise they make with their feet, when they return to war, and by the fire, which they make to arise, when they strike their feet against stones; that run lightly through jealousie, and raise the dust in the midst of enemies, that man is ingratefull for the graces of his Lord, he himself is witnesse of his ingratitude, and too much affecteth the riches of the earth; knoweth he not  ^^^t God will make all the world to revive? that he will ^^ing to light whatsoever is most secret in the hearts of ^en? and that he knoweth all that they have done?   CHAP. CI. The Chapter of affliction containing eleven Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. When the extreme affliction shall appear, I will not tell thee in what time this shall be, then shall all men be assembled, stretched out like Quilts, and the mountaines shall be like carded wool. Such whose ballance shall be weighty with good works, shall go into Paradise; and they whose ballance shall be light of good works, shall go into hell, they shall go into a fire so hot, that I am not able to expresse the heat.   CAAP. CII. The Chapter of Abundance, containing eight Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. Certainly all your care even to the grave, is in the abundance of your wealth; but ye shall hereafter learne, ye shall hereafter learn the truth; If ye had knowledge, ye would meditate on the torments of hell, you shall see one day, that they are indubitable, then shall ye ask where is Paradise?    CHAP. CIII. The Chapter of the Evening. IN the name of God,It is an hour appointed to the Mahometans to pray. gracious and mercifull. I sweare by the hour of the Evening, that men are inclined to their destruction, except such as believe in God, that do good works, and have in esteem truth and perseverance.   CHAP. CIIII. The Chapter of Persecution, containing seven Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. Misery is upon him that persecuteth his neighbour; persecution hath its Counter-persecution. He that heapeth up treasures, and is busied to count them, thinketh they will make him immortall, but they shall precipitate him into his misery; I will not tell thee into what misery, but the fire of hell is alwaies kindled to burn the heart of the wicked; they shall be over-whelmed in flames, and bound to great pillars.   CHAP. CV. The Chapter of Elephants, containing five Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. Considerest thou not how thy Lord intreated them that came mounted upon Elephants, to ruin the Temple of Mecca? Was not their conspiracy their own destruction? God sent against them flying Troops, that threw upon them stones, whereon were imprinted their names; he made them like to corn sown in fields, devoured by beasts.    CHAP. CVI. The Chapter of Coreis, containing four Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. Coreis had no humanity for them; the people come every winter, and every summer, to worship the God of the Temple of Mecca, which nourisheth and delivereth them from famine and fear.   CHAP. CVII. The Chapter of the Law, containing seven Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. Sawest thou him that blasphemed against the Law? He it is that devoureth the substance of Orphans, and the bread of the poor: Misery is upon them that are not attentive to their prayers, that are hypocrites, and hinder men to do well.   CHAP. CVIII. The Chapter of Affluence, containing three Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. We have given thee a great affluence of our graces. Pray to thy Lord, lift up thine hands, he that ha^eth thee, shall be accursed.    CHAP. CIX. The Chapter of Infidells, containing six Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. Oh Infidells, Idolaters! I worship not what ye worship, and ye worship not what I worship; I will not worship that which ye worship, and ye will not worship that which I worship; you observe your Law, and I mine.   CHAP. CX. The Chapter of Protection, containing four Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. A great number of people embrace the Law of God, when he protecteth the true believers, and giveth them vic^ory. Exalt his glory, and implore pardon of him, he is most mercifull.   CHAP. CXI. The Chapter of the Cord of Palme, containing eleven Verses, written at Mecca.  Gelaldin entituleth this the Chapter of Losse.The wife of Ablheb did cast stones in Mahomets way, in contempt. See Bedaoi.  IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. Ablheb lost his hand; God chastised him, his riches shall not save him, he shall burn in eternall flames, with his wife that carrieth wood upon her neck, bound with a cord of Palme.    CHAP. CXII. The Chapter of Salvation containing four Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. Say unto unbelievers, God is eternall, he neither begetteth nor is begotten, and hath no companion.   CHAP. CXIII. The Chapter of Separation, containing five Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. Say unto them, God, who hath separated light from darknesse, shall defend me from all the evills that he hath created, from danger, darknesse, from them that blow against the knot of the string, from Sorcerers, and the envious.   CHAP. CXIV. The Chapter of the People, containing six Verses, written at Mecca. IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. Say unto them, I will beware of the temptations of the Devil, and the malice of the people, through the assistance of the Lord, and King of the people. FINIS.      THE LIFE AND DEATH OF MAHOMET THE PROPHET of the Turks, And AUTHOR OF THE ALCORAN. MAHOMET, the son of Abdalla, a vicious Pagan, was born Posthumus at Now a City called Medina-talnabi [i.e.] the Town of the Prophet. Jesrab, then a Village of Arabia Fe^ix; his Mother a Jewesse, both by birth and Religion, dying when he was two yeares old, left him to his Some will have to be his grandfather. Uncle Abdal Mutalib, who being of vile condition, and unable to give him education above the common ignorance and irreligion of his Countrey, at the age of sixteen ye^rs, abandoned him  to fortune, or after the barbarous custome of the Arabians, sold him to the Ismalite Merchants, who exposing him to sale in the Markets, he was purchased by Abdemonople, a wealthy Merchant; He after some observation, and experience of his wit and industry, withdrew him from the common drudgery of a slave, to employ him with his other factors in Commerce, and finding him apt for those affaires, gave him the conduct of his Camels into Syria, Aegypt, Persia, and elsewhere. By which, in a short time, he became so expert in his Trade, that as be encreased the wealth and profit of his Master, so he gained his good will, and affection. At that time Heraclius being Emperor of the East, and the sea^mlesse coat of the Church torne by variety of Sects, and Heresies, the Bishops and Governors in Constantinople justly fearing divine vengeance, by reason of the Nestorian heresie, which with that of the Monothelites, began afresh to infect their Clergie, deliberated on some Ecclesiasticall censure against them: When Sergins a Monke, and Sectary of Nestorius, conscious of his error, and dreading the punishment, fled secretly into Arabia, and found retreat and entertainment with Abdemonople, the master of Mahomet, where finding slender hopes of propagating his infectious Heresie (the family being Pagans) and lesse of overthrowing his opposites in Religions, he resolved to take revenge on Christianity it self, and to that effect began to practise on Mahomet, as a Subject prepared to receive the impression of his design. In the mean time, Abdemonople dyed, his riches being augmented through the care and industry of Mahomet, who having before insinuated into the favor of his Mistris Aijffa, by presents of rare toyes, procured in his Travels, by them, or through Sorcery (of which he was held guilty, and laboureth to purge himself in his Alcoran) so charmed her affection, that of her slave, he was advanced to be Lord both of her person, and fortunes. Being thus grown opulent, he sometime continued his trade, but then willing to take ease, as he had, during his voyages through severall Countries, been a Seeker, and inquisitive concerning the diversity of Religions professed through the universe, so now (though irresolute which to follow) he rejected all, as vain, and foolish, except Judaisme and Christianity, and approving the latter as the best, accordingly framed his life, assuming a specious forme of Sanctimony, which brod admiration in them that considered his former education, and gave him a repute above his expectation. But this hasty fruit was soon corrupted, and with the touch of Ambition (like the Apples of Sodom) soon vanished into stink and filthinesse. For Sergius, as subtile, as malicious, observing his disposition, and withall, after some discourse concerning the two Religions, of both which he found him excellently ignorant, seeing it no difficulty to distill into him the poyson of his Herefic, easily perswaded him, That Jesus Christ was but man simply; that for the merit of his vertues he was held as Deified: that the sufferings of his death were but humane inventions; that he was transported from this life to an immortall, and glorious, by another way then that of Death: That there is but one God, in one Person; so that the Faith of the Christians is vain, and invented; and that of the Jewes too loose and leane, through their owne obstinacy. That the Arabians being a dull and ignorant people, inclining neither to the one nor the other, but all (as many as had been touched with the fame of his new sanctity) admiring his perfections; The Jewes and Christians being likewise enemies to each other, and the Christians at variance among themselves; He might in that juncture of affairs, assume the title of a Prophet sent from God, to disabuse the one and the other, and save the world by another Law. This Counsell of Sergius took the desired effect, and Mahomets thoughts, before enflamed with his new gotten wealth, and fame, now entertained more ar^^cu^ desires  of being esteemed a Prophet, looking upon all other attributes of Religion, and sanctity, as vile and abject. To this effect, on a sudden he retires to a solitary Cave, not far distant from Mecca, while Sergius proclaimed the vain perfections of his life, and filled the ears of the people with the noise of his deservings. The terme of two years expired, Mahomet again appears to the world, and as if newly returned from Oracles of Heaven, stileth himself a Prophet sent from God, who willing through his mercy, to withdraw him from that precipice of his everlasting ruine, and admonish him of his error, afflicted his body with the falling-sicknesse, which Mahomet instead of repenting, made an advantage to promove his wicked design. For his wife lamenting to see her self yoaked to one so diseased, and tormented with an hideous infirmity, be excused it, and easily wrought in her a beliefe, that being constrained frequently to converse with the Angel Gabriel, his fraile body, unable to abide the splendor of his heavenly presence, fell into that distemper, and at the departure of the divine Ambassador, recovered its former condition. His wife believing this, was not wanting to divulge the rare qualities of her husband, his admirable sanctity, and frequent converse with the Angell, which gained him the esteem of a Prophet in his own house, and reverence among his Neighbours. That this Infant-repute of his Holinesse might be the better strengthened, Mahomet thought it requisite to promulgate some Chapters of his Alcoran (as a Remonstrance of his Commission) which as he saw occasion, he shaped (though ill-favouredly) to his designes, giving out that he received them from the Angel Gabriel, as the Counsells and precepts of God, who for that he had not saved men, either by the Law of Moses, the Psalmes of David, or the Gospell of Jesus Christ, did now promise them infallible Salvation by the means of the Alcoran, which though rudely, yet cunningly contrived, as complying with the loose humour of the Arabians, enjoyning nothing strict or burthensome, but leaving  all to liberty; as the sole means to allure them to a belief of it, induced first the Parents and allies of his wife, then the more ignorant and meaner sort to embrace it, and esteeme Mahomet as the Messenger of God sent to guide them into eternall felicity, and the enjoyment of Paradise, which the easier to ensnare them, he fained to be full of such pleasures as fall under sense, and a plentifull fruition of those delights, that in those more barren and desert parts of Arabia they exceedingly wanted. Having thus drawn to his devotion, a numerous, though vulgar party of the people, who in opinion of his Propheticall Function were prompt to his obedience; he thought it altogether as easie to obtain a Kingdome, as he had found it not difficult to attain to the title of a Prophet; and to effect this, having before, under pretence of Reformation of Religion, gained many followers, while more stood as lookers on, not at all regarding that Decoy; he resolved to yoak to it that other concomitant in popular disturbances, liberty, proclaiming it to be the will of God, that all men should enjoy it, and that the Edict might be first obeyed in his own family, enfranchized his Slave, called Zeidi. This bait, as it inhaunced his fame, so it added to his retinue: for as multitudes, affecting novelty, and a mutation of condition, daily added themselves to his party; so slaves from all parts of Arabia forsook their Masters, and fled to him as their Redeemer, and embraced his Law, as the means of their salvation. These through a fond conceit of his piety, ready to sacrifice their lives at his command, he divided into troops, and sent to rob the Caravans of Merchants that travelled through the deserts, and by this means, having added to his treasure by spoil; and his retinue daily encreasing by a multitude of Fugitives and Vagabonds, who by reason of his liberty, to act any villany, resorted to him; he at length took up thoughts of imploying them in the confirmation of his Law, which he knew to be the ready way to his establishment, in that power to which he aspired. To this purpose he marcheth with his Troops towards Medina (the place of his birth and buriall) to preach in a Synagogue of Jewes there inhabiting. These lesse stupid then the Arabians, could not indure his impostures, and instead of believing, did handsomely beat him, and drive his train from the town. This repulse rather irritating then terrifying him, he drew all his force into the field, and assailed the Jewes in two severall conflicts; in one of which, by a wound on the face with a sword, that broke out his fore-teeth: He signed the Articles of his Law with his blood, and continued a long time as dead in a ditch; but being rescued by his Slaves, and recovered of his wound, he again fought and vanquished them, and converted their Synagogue into a Temple, for his own use. The fame of his exploits increasing, with the number of his Sectaries (to whom some Princes and eminent persons of the Countrey began to incline, giving him their daughters in marriage) awakened the Nobles of Mecca, particularly the family of Coreis, who wisely judging a new form of Religion, propagated by a new way, force of arms, must inevitably introduce a new Government, of which Mahomet, of base and obscure beginnings would be chief, as the Author, opposed themselves to his designs, expelled all such as seemed to favour him, out of the City, and severall times gave him battell; in which he so valiantly deported himself, that though he was somtimes put to the worst, yet he more often prevailed; and giving freedome to such prisoners as would imbrace his Law, encorporated them into his Army, strengthning himself, and weakning his enemies. Being in fine a compleat Conqueror in the field, he assaulted the City of Mecca, took it, and after some slaughter of the Nobility, his enemies, proclaimed impunity to all that would acknowledge him a Prophet of God, by whose favour (as he affirmed) and appointment, not by his own valour, he had attained to that honor. After this Proclamation, many for fear of present danger, and apprehension of future bondage, more out of ignorance imbraced his beliefe, and he injoyed the vaine felicity, to see  himself Generall of an Army, Lord of a vast Countrey, and to be esteemed, and reverenced as a Prophet. About that time Heraclius the Emperor, disposing himselfe rather to improve the Heresie of the Monothelites, then to defend the Confines of the Empire, not onely permitted Mahomet to domineere in Arabia, but gave advantage to Cosroes the Persian King, to invade his Dominions: but at length awakened by the alarmes of so puissant an enemy, levied a strong Army, and summoned the Sarra signifies in their tongue a Desart, and Sahen to inhabit. Saracens (a people so called from their inhabiting the Desart) to his assistance. The Persian vanquished, and the Saracens expecting the salarie of their labours, and with some importunity demanding it, were answered, that the Emperor had not sufficient Treasure to pay the Christian Troops, and therefore those Heathen Dogs must attend the conveniency of their Prince. Incensed by this contempt, they retired,See ^^^ds his Travell. and marched by the way of Africk, where finding Mahomet busie to inlarge his power; he aggravated their discontents, affirming it to be the Will of God, that all men should injoy their Liberty, that God was offended at their oppressions, and willed them to oppose the tyranny of the Christians, and that whosoever died in that holy war, his soul should be instantly transported to Paradise. These motives raised them to a resolution of making defection, so that they elected Mahomet their Generall, who incontinently deprived the Emperor Heraclius of his Tribute, and his Officers (who were slaine in demanding it) of their lives. After this act, the whole Province, which that of Egypt, revolted, and the people generally esteeming the successe of Mahomets armes (which he was diligent to imploy) as a sure testimony of the goodnesse of his Cause, embraced his Religion. Heraclius having neglected to strangle this rebellion, in its birth, indeavoured to extinguish it, being now growne to considerable strength; and to that end sent an Army under the Conduct of Theodesius his Favorite;  his Army was twice overthrowne, the Generall slaine, and the Mahometans pursuing their victories, tooke from the Greeks the Countries of Egypt, Syria; and other Provinces of Africa, where Mahomet increased his Triumphs, and erected his Trophies. Being now growne impotent, rather through his inordinate life, then burthen of years, he retired full of glory, as a King and Prophet, to Mecca, where he resolved to end his dayes, having affirmed it in the Alcoran to be the most holy City of the world, as that wherein stood the Temple of Abraham, built miraculously by Angells, to be the Sanctuary of all that repaire thither in Pilgrimage. And therefore it was, that when he had by his Armies taken the City of Antioch, he durst not enter into it in person, lest by the delightfull and fertile scituation of it, he should have been inticed to desert Mecca; and contradict his own Prophesie. His life now drawing to a period, a Plurisie surprized him; On the seventh day, for Crisis of his disease, he became frantique. Haly, one of his successors, ^stonisht at his distemper and frenzie, not esteeming it one of the rare qualities of a Prophet and Redeemer (as he stiled himself) of so much people, derided him, yet willing to continue his Law, that he might inherit his Power, carefully concealed it, and according to his commands (yet living) watched his body after his decease. For he told his followers, that he should rise again the third day, and ascend to heaven. They observed this, and guarding his Corps four daies intire, with impatient expectation of his Resurrection, were at length compelled by reason of its putrifaction, to take him up, ond bury him at Medina, where his Reliques are annually visited by the superstitious Pilgrims of his Religion. Thus Mahomet the Prophet of the Turks, and Author of the Alcoran, died on the twelf day of the Month June. Rabeg, in the great climatericall yeare of his Age, having abused men with his horrible impostures, full 23. years, dwelling in the esteem of a Prophet; ten at Mecca, and thirteen at Medina. His coming was  some years after the year of our Saviour 600. Heraclius being Emperor at Constantinople, Sadinion Bishop of Rome; Clotaire King of France, Viteric of Spain, and Edbald of England. He was of stature not tall, large sinews, and brown color, broad face, his head disproportioned to his Body: yet may we well imagine the beauty of his body, to surpasse that of his mind, which was full of deceit, vicious, and cruell, never sparing any thing to advance his lust (in which he equalled himselfe to forty men) or to procure his revenge. He was (as himselfe confessed) altogether illiterate, and though by nature subtile, and quick witted, yet often pusled for the invention of delusive Miracles, to confirme the Arabians in their Belief. For he continually preached to them, that God had sent him to confirm his Law by force of Armes, and not by Miracles; yet the people instantly demanding them, as signs of his Mission, he was constrained first to tell them of a certain voyage to Heaven, which was briefly thus. The Angel Gabriel, with threescore and ten pair of wings, came to him by night, as he was in bed with his wife Aijssa, told him God had sent for him, he going down with this Angell, found at his door an Heterogeneous beast, called Elborach, halfe Asse, halfe Mule, but much swifter then either: (for it would go as far at one step as the most quick-sighted could see) this Beast, or believer of the Alcoran, would not let Mahomet mount him, unlesse he would first promise to pray for him, which the charitable Prophet did, and was in the twinkling of an eye brought by him to Jerusalem, where the Angel Gabriel tyed the Beast with his girdle to a rock, and taking Mahomet on his shoulders, carried him to heaven-gate. They knocked, and the Porter understanding Mahomet to be there, instantly opened, and bade him welcome; In this first Heaven he saw Angels, of divers and monstrous shapes; some composed of fire and snow, others of fire alone, every of them diversly shaped; among the rest, one with the head of a Cock, whose feet touched one Heaven, and head another (each Heaven being distant from the other, a voyage  of five hundred years) and when he crowes (which is his language) he moves the Cocks of the earth to crow: This Angell recommended him to another, he to a third, and so one to another, until he came to the Heaven, where God kept his residence. God curteously received him, asked him how his people did, how they entertained his Law, and familiarly laid his hand upon his shoulder, which was so cold, that it pierced to the marrow of his backbone. God had soon done with him, only telling him how often his people should make their prayers, which were so many, that as he was returning, in the fourth Heaven, Moses advised him to go back to God, and entreat him that fewer prayers might serve his turne, for his people were not able to make so many; which he did, and after many returnes, brought the number to five. This done, he went back to his Elborach, which in a moment brought him to his house in Mecca, where he went to bed again to his wife, she not once dreaming her husband would leave heaven for her company, or thinking he had been there; all this he performed in the tenth part of a night. The Turks at this day fondly believe this as a truth, but the Arabians of his time requiring him to do as much in their view, he (unwilling to take again so long a journey) replyed, Praised be God, I am man and an Apostle. He had other slights, which in sight of the people, by Art or Sorcery, he performed, and they stupidly believed, and entertained as miracles: as a Pigeon being by him taught to come and pick a pease out of his eare, he told them it was the holy Ghost that came to tell him what God would have him do; so an Oxe brought him a Chapter of the Alcoran upon his hornes, in a full assembly. He likewise perswaded them, that being at dinner at the house of one that pretended to be his friend (who had an intent to poison him, or he at least was so informed) a shoulder of mutton served in to the table, fore-warned him, that he should not eat of it; and though many were present, none but he heard or understood the language of the mutton, and yet he permitted one of his deerest friends to eat of it, and die impoisoned.  Such, and many of the like nature were his miracles: As the bowing of trees, shaken by some sudden gust of wind: the howling of Wolves, and braying of Asses, which is their language, desiring Mahomet to pray for them; and he Prophetically understanding, as religiously performed. His custome was often to inculcate into the ears of his Auditors, that God gave him commission to fulfill his own desires in all things; and to that purpose introduceth God speaking to him. To thee O Prophet! It is permitted to lie with all women that are given thee, or thou dost purchase, thy Aunts and kindred, and all good women that freely desire thy company, and this is lawfull for thee alone. His issue was one only Son, called Casfim, who died before him, and many daughters; Fatione the eldest (in high esteem at this day among the Arabians, and honoured as the royall root of Aben Alabecy) was wife to Haly. Zeineb the second was married to Osmen, after son to Mahuvias, and perhaps to both successively, for they both succeeded in the Empire of Arabia; to her is attributed the originall of the other family of Aben Humeia. Imiaultim and Naphisse are diversly mentioned by the most faithful Historians, some delivering them as his daughters, others as his neer kindred. On the Seal which he used, were ingraven these words, Mahomet, Messenger of God. Heaven ordained him to be a scourge for the punishment of Christians, who in multitudes at that time had forsaken the truth, to follow the Sects and Heresies of the Arrians, Donatists, Nestorians, and others. The day of his death was no lesse prodigious, then the course of his life, a Comet resembling a sword, appearing at high noon, pointing from South to North, when it was behold the space of thirty daies, which that age interpreted to portend the fatall rising and spendor of the Arabian Empire. FINIS.    A needfull Caveat or Admonition, for them who desire to know what use may be made of, or if there be danger in reading the Alcoran. By Alexander Ross. GOod Reader, the great Arabian Imposter now at last after a thousand years, is by the way of France arrived in England, and his Alcoran, or Gallimaufry of Errors (a brat as deformed as the Parent, and as full of heresies as his scald-head was of scurffe) hath learned to speak English. I suppose this piece is exposed by the Translator to the publike view, no otherwise then some Monster brought out of Africa, for people to gaze, not to dote upon; and as the sight of a Monster, or mishapen creature should induce the beholder to praise God, who hath not made him such; so should the reading of this Alcoran excite us both to blesse Gods goodnesse towards us in this land, who injoy the glorious light of the Gospell, and behold the truth in the beauty of holinesse; as also to admire Gods judgements, who suffers, so many Countreyes to be blinded and inslaved with this mishapen issue of Mahomets braine, being brought forth by the help of no other midwifry, then of a Jew and a Nestorian, making use of a tame Pigeon (which he had taught to pick corn out of his ears, instead of the Holy Ghost, and causing silly people to believe that in his falling  sicknesse (to which he was much subject) he had conference with the Angell Gabriel. I know the publishing of the Alcoran may be to some dangerous and scandalous, dangerous to the reader, scandalous to the higher powers, who notwithstanding have cleared themselves by disliking the publishing, and questioning the publishers thereof; but for the danger, I will deliver in these ensuing propositions my opinion, yet with submission to wiser judgements. 1. Though it may be dangerous to such as like reeds are shaken, and like empty clouds carried about with every wind of doctrin, yet to staid and solid Christians, the reading of Mahomets Heresies wilbe no more dangerous, then the reading of those errors which are recorded in Scripture, for in them are mentioned many damnable errors and abominations of the Egyptians, Cananites, Hittites, Sidonians, and other Gentiles, and of the Hebrews themselves, of the Sadduces who denied Spirits, Angells, and the Resurrection. 2. Is there more in reading the Alcoran, then in reaing the Errors of ancient and modern Heretikes? surely Tertullian, Irenaus, Epiphanius, Austin, and other Fathers were not of this opinion, who have left upon record to posterity, the damnable heresies of Arians, Eutychians, Nestorians, Macedonians, and others: and in the Alcoran there are not such dangerous errors as among the Tetratheites, Angelites, and Theodosians, who held there were four Gods, or the Tritheites, who affirmed there were three, or the Gnosticks, Manicheans, Cerdonians, Marcionites, who maintained there were two contrary Gods, the one good, the other bad, whereas the Alcoran sets down there is but one true God; and although it denieth with Arius, the Divinity of Christ, yet it holds him a great Prophet; nor doth it speak so blasphemously of Christ as the Simonians, who held Simon Magus, or the Ophites, and Manicheans, who said, the Serpent was Christ, or Menander, who affirmed himself to be Christ, and the Saviour of the world. Besides; are not the damnable Heresies of the modern Familists, who deny Christs  Divinity, making as many Christs, as there be illuminated Elders in their Congregations? are not also the Heresies of the Socinians, Antitrinitarians, Adamites, Ser^etians, Antisabbatarians, and many others exposed to the view of all that will read them? why then may not the Alcoran? Besides, are men debarred from reading the Greek and Latine Poets? nay, are not many of them translated into our English tongue? as also the modern Histories of the East and West Indies, wherein are more damnable tenets then any in the Alcoran, and they who have read the Jewish Talmud, and Cabala, will find them as ridiculous pieces as the Alcoran. 3. If there were any lovelinesse, beauty, excellency, or any thing else in the Alcoran that might win the mind, and draw the affection after it, I should hold the reading of it dangerous, but whereas it is such a mishapen and deformed piece, I think the reading of it will confirm us in the truth, and cause us love the Scripture so much the more: for as a beautifull body is never more lovely then when she is placed neer a Black-moore, neither is truth more amiable then when it is beset with Errors. Opposita juxta se posita clarius elucescunt, the Gem receives lustre from the foile, the starrs from the night, and fire is most scorching in Frost, even so by an Antiperistasis truth is fortified by error. Who can think that the sight of a Hob-Goblin, or deformed vizard should draw the child from the Nurse or brest of the Mother to embrace it, whereas the sight thereof will rather cause the child hold faster by the mother. The wise Spartans oft-times brought drunkards into the room where their sons were, not that they should be induced thereby to love, but to abhorr drunkkenness, which they could not have done, had they not seen the unseemly and rude carriage, the undecent behaviour, and uncomposed gestures of the drunkard. When Zisca had destroyed the Adamits of Bohemia, he preserved two alive that they might reveal to the world the wicked errors of that Sect: Who is so mad as to prefer the embracements of a filthy Baboon, to his beautifull Mistresse, or the braying of an Asse to a consort of Musick? he deserves  the ears of Midas that will prefer the Cuckoes song to the ^weet notes of the Nightingale. 4. Though the Alcoran be received among many Na^ions, yet this reception proceeds not from any love they bear to it, or any lovelinesse they find in it, but partly out of fear, being forced by the Sword, partly out of a preposterous desire of liberty and preferment, and partly out of ignorance, as not being suffered to read the Scriptures, nor to hear Philosophy, by which the errors thereof may be detected, nor to enquire into the absurdities thereof, or to dispute and question any thing in it: for which cause also it is not suffered to be Printed, nor are Christians permitted to enter into Mecca, least their absurdities and impieties of their Religion should be manifested: and thus are those silly souls kept in blindnesse and ignorance, and therefore I never read that any Nation did voluntarily receive the Alcoran, except the theevish Saracens of Arabia, because it was a friend both to their theevery and lechery, as permitting multiplicity of Wives and Concubines, and a reward for those that shall murther and rob. 5. The Alcoran is translated into French and other vulgar Tongues, and the chief heads thereof by Purchas in his Pilgrimage, by Heilin in his Geography, and by others into our own tongue without scruple or exception; and I pray you, why is the Arabick tongue, the language of that false Prophet, and in which he writ his Alcoran, so much learned and taught in Schools and Christian Universities, but that by it we may come to the knowledge of Mahomets La^ and Religion? and how should we know this little ho^n in Daniel, that spake high and proud things against the Almighty, if we read not his life and doctrine? 6. There is a kind of necessity we should know evill as well as good, falshood as well as truth, that we may avoid the one, and so much more love the other; he that hath smelled a stinking weed will smell with more delight the sweet Rose, he that reads the Alcoran will find it smell worse then Mahomets carkasse did, which after his death lay putrifying upon the ground, which his disciples  permitted for many daies together, hoping he would have been as good as his word, who made them a promise that he would rise again the third day; but at last finding he had forgot himself, and that his body smelling not so sweet as Alexanders did after his death, they were forced to bury it, or otherwaies the dogs who were beginning to bury him in their guts had saved them a labour, though Sugar be sweet in it self, yet it is much more sweet to him, that hath tasted Aloes; and though Italy in it self be a delicious Countrey, and garden of the world, yet it is much more delightfull, pleasant, and beautifull, to him who hath passed over the mountanous, craggy, and rugged Alps: Did not the Prodigall love the bread of his fathers house evermore the better after he had been fed on husks with swine? doubtlesse we shall find, that after we have fed a while upon the course husks of the Alcoran, with the Arabian swine, we shall with much more eagernesse covet after the plenty of our Fathers house, exhibited to us in his Word, where we shall find the hidden Manna, the bread of Life, that came down from heaven. 7. Books of Palmistry, Phisiognomy, judiciall Astrology, Necromancy; and other superstitious and impious Arts have been permitted to come abroad, that men might see the vanity of those Arts, the knavery and wickednesse of the Artists, the foolishnesse of credulous people, who suffer themselves to be deluded by them, and the malice of Satan the arch-enemy of mankind, whose delight is to abuse, delude, and destroy men: why then may not the Alcoran be read, that men may see the vanity, impiety, and foolishnesse of it, by which the world hath been so many yeare cheated and abused? 8. They that learn Arts and Sciences, desire the knowledge, not only of the good things, but of the evill things also, and the abuse of them, to the end they may avoid them; there Logick speaks as well of sophisticall and fallacious syllogismes, as of demonstrative and topicall; Ethicks treats of vices as well as of vertues; Naturall Philosophy handleth the natures* not only of usefull and  beneficiall creatures, but also of hurtfull and venomous, as of Serpents; Physick speaks of poysons as well as of cures; Historians describe both the vertuous and vicious actions of Princes; in Divinity we learn, not only what God and good Angells are, but also what Sathan is, and his wicked Angells; in Navigation we must know, not only what places are Navigable, but also what are not* how shall we avoid Rocks, Quick-sands and Shelves if we know them not? even so Christian Religion permits not only the reading of Scripture, but also of hereticall and heathenish books, as is said, that we may know what to embrace, what to shun; therefore if you would know what be the damnable errors to be avoided by Christians, read the Alcoran, and you shall find in it the sink of all, or most part of ancient heresies. 9. In reading of the Alcoran, though it be, as Cato said of the three Romane Embassadors, that were to go to Antiochus, headlesse, heartlesse, and footlesse, the one being maimed in his head, the second a fool, and the third lame in his feet, I say, though it be without head or tail, as we use to speak, being immethodicall and confused, contradictory in many things, written in a rude Language, the Author himself being no Linguist or Scholler; nay, not able to read or write, though also it consist of lies and senselesse follies, yet this benefit we may reap; I say, in reading of it, that we shall be forced to admire and praise the goodnesse of God towards us Christians, who having suffered a great part of the world to sit in the valley of the shadow of death, to be oppressed with Cimmerian, yea more then palpable Egyptian darknesse, hath placed us in the Temple, where we have the golden Candlestick of his Word, and a clearer and more durable Lamp then that of Salomons Temple, yea even the Sun of righteousnesse shining upon us in the Land of Goshen, whilst a great part of the world doth follow the Antichristian beast, we follow the Lamb upon mount Sion; while they hear the voice of Satyres, Ostrages, and Schrich Owls, we hear the voice of the Turtle, and the Songs of Sion in our own Land: whilst they feed on husks with  swine, and drink the corrupted puddles of Mahomets inventions, we are fed with Angels food, and eat coelestiall Manna, and drinke of the pure river of life, cleare as Crystall: Againe, we may tremble at the reading of this Alcoran, when we consider the severity of Gods judgements, and the fiercenesse of his anger, who for the contempt of his Gospell, in those Countreyes where Mahomet is worshipped, hath suffered so many millions of people to be deluded, blinded, abused, and inslaved by that false Prophet, to believe his lies; and by loathing the sweet Evangelicall Manna, to de^oure greedily the poisonable guailes of his doctrine, and with it the wrath of God, which hath falne on them, whilst the flesh is between their teeth, so that they must needs perish everlastingly. Who would have thought that those Countreyes which were honoured by Gods owne presence, by the Oracles of the Prophets, by the presence, miracles and preaching of Christ, by the planting of the Apostles, by the blood of so many Martyrs, should be thus besotted, and inslaved by the tyranny of this grand Impostor? When we thinke on those things, let us work out our salvation with feare and ^rembling, and let him who thinks he standeth take nee^ ^eas^ he fall: they were not greater sinners then we, therefore doubtlesse except we repent, we shall all likewise pe^^sn^ the ^e^issne^s of Heraclius Government, his fa^^ing into the heresie of the Mono^^ciites, the contempt of the Gospell, the ^^ighting of the Pastors, the wicked^esse of the people, the continuall Schismes, rents, ^^tres, and divisions of their Ch^rches, were both the causes and occasions of these miseries which have falne upon them* le^ (...) take ^eed ^ae^ we^^ ^ot partakers of their sins, least we also partake of their plagues. 10. The r^ading of the Alc^^an will in^o^e us to beat Mahomet with his own weapons, to (...) of the head of the (...) with his own sword, and to woun^ this unclea^ (...) with c^^ pikt out of his own ^ings, for even unwit^^^ and unwillingly, (...) is forced to acknowledge ma^^ (...) o^ (...) ^^^rming (...)  one true God the Creator of all things, and though he goeth about to overthrow the doctrine of the Trinity, yet he doth plainly confirm it; when he speaks of God, of the Word and of the Spirit, which three indeed are one (...) offence; though distinct in subsistence; though he laboure^^ to overthrow the Gospe^, yet he confirms it, when he calls it good, ful^, right, a light, and a guide to salvation, for if it be full, good, etc. what need was there of his Alcoran and though he indeavoureth to overthrow Christs Divinity with Arius and Nestorius, and the Jews his ghostly fathers, yet he affirms it, in calling Christ the Word* for as the internall word of the mind is coeternall with the mind, so is Christ the Word of his Father, coeternal with the Father; he establisheth also the Article of Christs Conception and Nativity, affirming h^rs to be conceived by the Holy Ghost, and born of the Virgin Mary, whom he confesseth to have been a pure Virgin, both before and after Christs birth: so he confirms the Article of Christs ascention into heaven, and divers other points of Christianity, to whom we are more beholding for his reverend esteem of Christ, then the Jews who revise and blaspheme ^^m. 11. In reading the Alcoran, though we find much ^ung* yet in it we shall meet with some gold, as Virgil did in reading of Ennius his Verses. Aeso^s Cock found a p^ecious stone in a ^^mghill where is much drosse some pure mettall will be found* even so in the dirt of the Alcoran you shall find some Jewells of Christian vertues, and indeed if Christians will but diligently read and observe the Lawes and Histories of the Mahometans, they may blush to see how zealous they are in the works of Devotion, Piety, and Charity, how devout, cleanly, and reverend in their Mosques, how obedient to their Priests, that even the great T^rk himselfe will attempt nothing without consulting his Mufti* how carefull are they to observe their hours of prayers five times a day wherever they are, or however imployed how constantly do they observe their ^asts from morning till night a whole moneth together? how ^o^^ng and cha^itable the Must^^mans are to each other, and how carefull of  strangers, may be seen by their Hospitalls, both for the poor and for travellers: if we observe their justice, temperance, and other morall vertues, we may truly blush at our own coldnesse, both in devotion and charity, at our injustice, intemperance, and oppression, doubtlesse these men will rise up in judgement against us; and surely their devotion, piety, and works of mercy are main causes of the growth of Mahometanisme, and on the contrary, our neglect of Religion, and loosenesse of conversation, is a main hindrance to the increase of Christianity; is it not a shame, that they should read over their Alcoran, once every moneth, and we scarce read over the Bible in all our life? that they shall give such reverence to their Alcoran, as to honour the very Camell that carried it to Mecca, and to lay up for holy reliques the napkins and handkerchiefs that rubbed off the sweat from his skin; and we shall prefer lascivious Poems, and wanton Ballads to the sacred Word of Almighty God? do we not make our selves unworthy of such an inestimable treasure? 12. The Turks are our neighbours, and their territories border upon the Dominions of Christendome: there have been continuall warres, and will be still between us; it concerneth every Christian who makes conscience of his waies, to examine the cause, and to look into the grounds of this war, whether they be just or not, which cannot be known but by reading the Alcoran, in which we see the Mahometans to be the enemies of the Crosse of Christ, in denying his Death, and of his Divinity also,Euseb. in vit.

We cannot do better service to our Countrey-men, nor offer a greater affront to the Mahometans, then to bring out to the open view of all, the blind Sampsons of their Alcoran, which hath mastered so many Nations, that we may laugh at it, of which even their own wise men are ashamed, and are sorry it should be translated into any other language; for they are unwilling that their grand Hypocrite should be unmasked, or that the vizard of his pretended holinesse should be taken off, whose filthy nakednesse must appear when he is devested: they know that words and works of darknesse cannot endure the light, Trepidantque immisso lumine manes, the infernall Ghosts tremble at any glimpse of light, and the wild beasts returne to their dens, saith David,Psal. 10.4. Vt jugulent homines surgunt de nocte latrones. when the morning appeares, not daring to seek their prey, but in the dark night of ignorance; this great thief Mahomet hath destroyed many thousand, and under the Lions skin, this Asse hath affrighted his beastly minded Saracens, therefore let us take away the ring from this Giges, by which he hath made himselfe invisible, and let us with Hercules pull out this theeving Cacus out of his darke den where he useth to hide and shelter himselfe, and expose his deformed carkasse to the publike view, that we may wonder at it: and in detecting his Errours, wee follow the practise of CHIST, who discovered to the world the damnable Tenets of the Scribes, Pharisees,Mat. 13. Hypocrites. 14. The Turks are preposterously zealous in praying for the conversion, or perversion rather, of Christians to their irreligious Religion, they pray heartily, and every day in their Temples, that Christians may imbrace the Alcoran, and become their Proselytes, in effecting of which they leave no means unassaied by feare and flattery, by punishments and rewards: Now, is it fitting that they in charity and zeale should exceed us? wee are bound to pray and endeavour heartily for their  conversion, from darknesse to light, from error to truth; but how shall we do this, if we know not the dangerous and damnable estate they are in, which we cannot know but by reading their Alcoran? 15. In reading the Alcoran we shall see what is the force of superstition, and with what violence men are carried head-long in the defence and maintenance even of the most absurd and impious opinions; what Hecuba is more deformed then the Alcoran? yet how do the Turks fight and struggle, toil and care, hazard life and liberty, estates and all for it, as if it were the most beautifull Helena in the world? these men cannot endure the Image of Christ, or of a Saint in their Temples, calling this Idolatry, and yet they are the greatest Idolaters in the world themselves, for never was there such an Idol as the Alcoran, no man must touch it, till first he be washed, and that being done, he must not touch it with his naked hands, but with a clean linnen cloth; the Priest must kisse it, and bow to it; he must when he reads in it hold it up on high, for it is a sin to hold it lower then his girdle: Every piece of paper that a Turk findes he must use reverendly, because the Alcoran is written in paper, the Mule that carries it to Mecca is held in great veneration, so that he or she is sanctified all the year after that can but touch him, and that handkerchief which wipeth off his sweat is a holy relique: thus do they strain at a gnat and swallow a Camell. Rev. 20.16. In reading the Alcoran and Turkish Story, we shall see who were Gog, and Magog, that made warre against the Saints, even the Turks an obscure people of Scythia, therefore called Gog, because they were hid and unknown a long time, and the Saracens who were a known people, and the open enemies of the Church, therefore called Magog; these treacherously combined together, oppressed first the Persians, and afterward the Greek Empire, with the famous Churches of  Asia, Greece, and Egypt: we shall also find that by the Star which fell from heaven, and opened the bottomlesse pit, whose smoke darkned the Sun, and out of which came the Locusts, whose terror is described by St. John,Rev. 9. is meant Mahomet that great destroyer, as his name signifieth, answering to the name Appollyon, and Abaddon: for never was there such a destroyer, who by his pestilent doctrine hath destroyed so many soules, and by the sword of his Locusts hath destroyed so many bodies, and ruinated so many goodly Countries. 17. If you will take a brief view of the Alcoran, you shall find it a hodg-podge made up of these four ingredients. 1. Of Contradictions. 2. Of Blasphemic. 3. Of ridiculous Fables. 4. Of Lyes. First, of Contradictions, he doth ordinarily say, and unsay the same thing; one while he tells us, that he was the first that ever entred into Paradise, and elsewhere he saies he found men and women there; sometimes he affirmes that Jews and Christians shall be saved by their own Religion, and sometimes again that none can be saved who embrace not his Alcoran; In one place following the Opinion of Origen, or rather of the Origenists, he affirmed that all the devills shall be saved; in another place he saith, only those devills shall be saved who hearken to, and obey his Alcoran. Secondly, of Blasphemy, for he blasphemeth God, in saying that he prayeth for Mahomet, intimating hereby that he is inferiour to that God he prayeth to; he makes God also swear by Flies, Wormes, and such base creatures, as if he were their inferiour, whereas God having none greater then himself, swears only by himself; He blasphemes the Father, in saying he cannot have a Son, because he is not married, as if there were no other generation but what is carnall; he b^asphemes the Son with Arius, in denying his Divinity; he blasphemes the Holy Ghost with Macedonius, affirming him to be the Creature of a creature; he blasphemes God also, in  making him the Author of his Alcoran, bragging that his name is written upon the Throne of God, in that he is the greatest of the Prophets, who hath more knowledge then all the men and Angels of the world: and many other bragging words he uttereth of himself, by which we may see he is that little horn which sprung up among the ten horns of the great and terrible beast of the Roman Empire, destroying three of the Roman horns, to wit, the Asians, Grecians, and Egyptians; this is the horn that hath many eyes, as being crafty and vigilant, but his mouth speaks proud things, in blaspheming and bragging, as we have heard. Thirdly, of ridiculous Stories, and which are more unsavory then the Golden Legend, or Lucians true Narrations; he tells us that he divided once the Moon, one half whereof fell into his lap, (this was not then the Man in the Moon, but the Moon in the Man) the other on the ground; these two pleces he fouldred again. Perhaps in memory of this lying miracle, the Turks use it the half Moon for their Armes: He tells us of a great army of men and Angels raised by Salomon, but much hindred in their march by an army of Flies, which Salomon rebuked, where we have a witlesse conference between Salomon and the fly; he tells you a strange story of Noahs Ark, how there the Hog was generated of the Elephants dung, and a Rat of the Hogs dung, which gnawing a hole in the Ark, at which Noah was affrighted; he touching the Lion on the forehead, out of whose brains leaped out a Cat, (as Minerva did out of Jupiters) which caused the Rat to run away: this is Philosophy indeed for a Hog. Fourthly, of Lies, for he belieth God, in making him author of his impiety and heresies; he belies Christ, in saying he was conceived by the smell of a Rose; he belyeth the Holy Ghost, in affirming that he inspired Mahomet to write the Alcoran; he belyeth the Virgin Mary, calling her the daughter of Amram, and sister of Moses, confounding her with Miriam, whereas there were so many generations between; he belyeth the Gospel, in saying it is corrupted by Christians; he belyeth Christians, when he saith they worship  many gods, and that they give to God a companion, when they acknowledg the Divinity of Christ; he belyeth the Jewes, in saying they make Elcazar a god; he belies the Patriarchs, in saying that Noah, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob believed his Alcoran, being so many thousand yeers before he was born, or his Alcoran had any existence: he belies also the Apostles, in making them his Schollers, who lived neer six hundred yeers before he was born. By all which we may see, who was the Compiler of this Alcoran; not the God of Truth, but the Father of Lies; not Christ and his Apostles, whose weapons in propagating the Gospel, were powerfull preaching, miracles, and patience in suffering; not the sword, the chief means that Mahomet useth to force his Alcoran, an instrument forbid by Christ, but used by him who hath beene a murtherer from the beginning. But I will not take upon me the task of refuting the Alcoran, being already refuted by Cantacuzenus, Richardus the Monk, Cusa the Cardinall, Woodmanstadius, Savanorolla, and others. I only thought good, upon intreaty of some learned and religious men, to annex this brief Caveat, that the Reader might be the better armed to encounter with any rub or difficulty be shall meet with in the reading thereof. But before I end, give me leave to cleare my self again in this point; that it is not my meaning all should have the liberty to read the Alcoran promiscuously. I know with the Apostle, that though all things be lawful, yet all things are not expedient; there are children as well as men in understanding: the nurse may use that knife which the child may not; and that sword which may without danger be handled by a sober man, cannot without danger be touched by a mad man: There are as well queasie as strong stomacks, and what is meat to the one, may be venome to the other. Though Mithridates could without hurt eat poyson, others may not presume to escape so; it is lawfull for any to look upon a monster, but it is not expedidient for conceiving women; that iron which an Estrich can digest, may destroy the stomack of other creatures:  how many have been deceived in gathering Hemlock for Parfly? It is not for every man to meddle with Apothecaries drug^, he may chance meet with poison as seen as an antidote* if all men were like Bees, to suck honey out of Henbane, there might be no danger in reading of the Alcoran, but most men are like Spiders, suck securely poison even out of the sweetest Roses; therefore they only may surely and without danger read the Alcoran, who are intelligent, judicious, learned, and throughly grounded in piety, and principles of Christianity; but weak, ignorant, inconstant, and disaffected minds to the truth, must not venture to meddle with this unhallowed piece, lest they be polluted with the touch thereof, as they were who came ^eer to a leprous body; and if we will not venture to go into an infected house without preservatives, much lesse should any dare to read the Alcoran, that is not sufficiently armed with grace, strength, and knowledge against all temtations. God grant we may walk in the light of the Gospel whilst we have in, that we may not be overwhelmed with the dismall night of Mahometane darknesse, which God may justly i^^tict upon us; for our sins, rents and divisions are no lesser then those were of the Greek, and Asiatick Churches, and doubtlesse except we repent we shall all perish with them, who for despising Gods sacred Oracles, are now taught to reverence every piece of paper they find, which they are made believe shall be put under the soles of their fee^ when they walk over the burning grate to their fools Paradise, as Busbequius in his Epistle tells us, who lived long amongst them, and was well acquainted with their opinions; but what I have written here concerning the Alcoran, I submit to the judgment and wisdom of those who sit at the Stern, and can see more then the Passengers.

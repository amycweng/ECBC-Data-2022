<HEAD>THE TRANSLATOR TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</HEAD>
<P>THere being so many Sects and Heresies banded together against the Truth, fin∣ding that of <HI>Mahomet</HI> wanting to the Muster, I thought good to bring it to their Colours, that so viewing thine enemies in their full body, thou mayst the better prepare to encounter, and I hope overcome them. It may hapily startle thee, to find him so to speak English, as if he had made some Conquest on the Nation, but thou wilt soon reject that feare, if thou consider that this his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> (the Ground-work of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Religion) hath been already translated into almost all Languages in Christendome, (at least, the most generall, as the <HI>Latin, Italian, French,</HI> &amp;c.) yet never gained any Proselyte, where the Sword, its most forcible, and strongest argument hath not prevailed: And indeed the greatest Doctors of their Religion have never alledged any thing for the truth thereof; but the suc∣cesse

of their wars, and greatnesse of their Empire, then which nothing is more fallacious: for that which both in former, and these latter Ages hath been com∣mon to the bad with the good, cannot be a certain e∣vidence of the justice of a Cause, or the truth of Re∣ligion.</P>
<P>Thou shalt find it of so rude, and incongruous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> composure, so fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ced with contradictions, obscene spee∣ches, and ridiculous fables, that some modest, and more rationall <HI>Mahometans</HI> have thus excused it, that their Prophet wrote an hundred and twenty thousand sayings, whereof three thousand only are good the residue (as the impossibility of the Moons falling into his sleeve, the Conversion and Salvation of the Devils, and the like) are false and ridi∣culous. Yet is the whole esteemed so sacred, that up∣on the Cover thereof is inscribed — <HI>Let none touch it but he who is clean.</HI> Nor are the vulgar permit∣ted to read it, but live and die in an implicite faith of what their Priests deliver; which indeed (as faith the learned <HI>Grotius</HI>) is a manifest argument of its iniquity:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grotius de ver. Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Christ.</NOTE> For that merchandise may justly be sus∣pected▪ which will not be sold, unlesse unseen: and though all men are not alike perspicacious in the knowledge, and discer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nig of things, some by arrogancy, and vain co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceit of themselves, others by affection; Some by custome, being drawn into error: yet should we belive that the way to eternall life can∣not not be understood by them, who without any respect of profit or preferment▪ seek it, submitting themselves, withall they have, to God, imploring his assistance, we should sin against his infinite goodnesse.

<HI>(Christian Reader)</HI> though some, conscious of their own instability in Religion, and of theirs (too like Turks in this) whose prosperity and opinions they follow, were unwilling this should see the Presse, yet am I confident, if thou hast been so true a votary to or∣thodox Religion, as to keep thy self untainted of their follies: this shall not hurt thee: And as for those of that Batch, having once abandoned the Sun of the Gospel, I believe they will wander as far into utter darkenesse, by following strange lights, as by this <HI>Ig∣nis Fatuus</HI> of the <HI>Alcoran.</HI> Such as it is, I present <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o thee, having taken the pains only to translate it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut of <HI>French,</HI> not doubting, though it hath been a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oyson, that hath infected a very great, but most un∣sound part of the universe, it may prove an Antidote, to confirme in thee the health of Christianity.</P>

<HEAD>THE FRENCH EPISTLE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THe Book is a long conference of God, the An∣gels▪ and <HI>Mahomet,</HI> which that false Prophet very grosly invented; sometimes he introduceth God▪ who speaketh to him, and teacheth him his Law▪ then an Angell, anon the Prophets, and fre∣quently maketh God to speak in the plurall, in a stile that is not ordinary. He declaimeth against such as worship Idols, particularly against the Inhabitants of the City of <HI>Mecca,</HI> and against the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The <HI>Co∣reis</HI> were a powerfull family in <HI>Arabia,</HI> in <HI>Maho∣mets</HI> time.</NOTE> <HI>Coreis,</HI> who were enemies to his designe. He intituled this book the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> as one would say, the Collection o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Precepts: He likewise termed it <HI>El Forcan,</HI> that is that distinguisheth good from evill: He divided i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into many Chapters, to which he gave what inscrip∣tion he thought good: he most commonly intitu¦leth them with words that are in their first line without regard to the matter they treat of, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> speaketh little of their Inscription; He divided in to many signs, or Verses, that contain his ordinan¦ces and fables, without observation either of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> consequence, or connexion of the discourse, whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB REF="5"/>
is the cause that thou shalt find in this Book a mul∣titude of incongruous pieces, and divers repetitions of the same things. It hath been expounded by ma∣ny Mahometan Doctors, their exposition being as ridiculous as the Text; They affirme the originall of the <HI>Alcoran</HI> to be written upon a Table kept in Heaven, that the Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> brought this Copy to <HI>Mahomet▪</HI> who could neither write nor read, and stile him Prophet, or Apostle, in honor. Thou shalt find at beginning of some Chapters letters of the <HI>Arabique</HI> Alphabet, which some men will not expound; They feare to utter things that may dis∣please their false Prophet: Most of their Doctors af∣firm those Letters to be the first letters of the Names of God. Thou shalt find the exposition in this ver∣sion; Thou wilt wonder that such absurdities have infected the best part of the world, and wilt a vouch, that the knowledge of what is contained in this Book, will render that Law contemptible.</P>

<HEAD>A Summary of the Re∣ligion of the TURKS.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Turks</HI> believe one sole God, in one sole Person, Creator of heaven and earth, the rewarder of the good, and punisher of the wicked; who hath crea∣ted Paradise for the recompense of the righteous, and Hell for the last punishment of crimes. They believe that <HI>Mahomet</HI> was a very great Prophet, whom God sent into the world to teach men the way of salvation, and call themselves <HI>Musulma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> that is to say, recommended to God, or saved.</P>
<P>They believe the Decalogue of <HI>Moses,</HI> and are obliged to observe it; they celebrate Friday as the Christians Sunday, that day they assemble in Temples at noon to pray.</P>
<P>They are obliged to pray five times a day, <HI>viz.</HI> in the morning, at noon, at the evening, when the Sun setteth, and an hour within night.</P>
<P>They fast the month, or moon, which they call <HI>Rama∣zan</HI>; during this month, they neither drink nor eat all the day, untill the Sun be set, but in the night drink and eat, according to their appetites, flesh and fish, ex∣cept the flesh of swine, and wine, that is at all times forbidden them; after this fast they have the feast of great <HI>Bairan,</HI> as the Christians Easter after Lent. They are great founders of Temples, and Hospitals, and are obliged to give to the poore the first day of the year, the tithe of what they have gained during the preceding yeare.</P>
<P><PB REF="6"/>They believe, that after being well washt, saying some prayer appropriate to that Ceremony; they have also the soul purified from all filthiness and sinne, which is the cause that they wash and bathe often, especially be∣fore they pray.</P>
<P>They have no Sacrament, but Circumcision; they cause their children to be circumcised at the age of seven or eight years; and when they can pronounce these words, <HI>La <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>a ill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ha Mehemet rasoul allha,</HI> that is, There is but one God, <HI>Mahomet</HI> is his Prophet and Apostle; this is their profession of Faith; nevertheless there is no mention of Circumcision in all the <HI>Alcoran</HI>; they say they observe it in imitation of <HI>Abraham,</HI> whose Law is recom∣mended to them by <HI>Mahomet</HI>: they believe that the <HI>Alco∣ran</HI> was brought to him at severall times by the Angel <HI>Gabriel,</HI> in the City of <HI>Mecca,</HI> and that of <HI>Medina,</HI> be∣cause the Jews and Christians had altered the holy Scrip∣tures, and the Law of God.</P>
<P>They are permitted to have four wives, married at the same time, and as many Concubines as they are able to maintain.</P>
<P>They can put away their wives when they think fit, paying them what they promised them in contract of marriage, and marry again at their pleasure; but the women are bound to tarry untill they are assured that they a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith childe before they marry again; and their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>re obliged to keep, and take the care of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> The children which they have by their slaves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>rently esteemed with those of their wives, and are a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> held as legitimate.</P>
<P>They have Temples, Colledges, and Hospitalls well revenued; they have covents of Religious, that live ex∣emplarily; obey their Superiours without contradiction, and dance after the sound of Flutes and other instruments when they make their prayers.</P>
<P>They have moreover another sort of Religious Va∣gabonds through the world, clothed like fools of that Country; they often go naked, and cut their skin in ma∣ny
<PB REF="7"/>
places, are held to be holy persons, and live by alms, which are never refused them; both the one and the o∣ther sort of Religious are called <HI>Dervis,</HI> they are known by their habit, and can retire and marry when they please.</P>
<P>They deny Jesus Christ to be God, or the Son of God; neither believe they in the holy Trinity: they say that Jesus Christ was a great Prophet, born of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> a Virgin both before and after her delivery; that he was conceived by divine inspiration, or by a divine breath, without a father, as <HI>Adam</HI> was created without a mother; that he was not crucified, that God took him into heaven, and that he shall come again on earth at the end of the world to confirm the Law of <HI>Mahomet</HI>; they likewise affirm that the Jews thinking to crucifie Jesus Christ, crucified a man among them that resembled him.</P>
<P>They pray to God for the Dead, they invoke their Saints,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A great question a∣mong <HI>Ma∣hometans.</HI></NOTE> of whom they have a large Legend, neverthe∣less they believe not Purgatory; and many among them imagine that the soul and body remain together in the grave until the day of Judgment.</P>
<P>They have <HI>Mecca</HI> and <HI>Medina,</HI> that are two Cities of <HI>Arabia,</HI> in great veneration, because <HI>Mahomet</HI> was born at <HI>Mecca,</HI> and buried at <HI>Medina</HI>: they make thither great pilgrimages, and believe that Land to be Holy: They bear likewise singular respect to the City of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, for that it hath been the Birth-place, and ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f many Prophets.</P>
<P>They use no Clocks; at the hour of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rs their Priests ascend the highest part of the Tower, that is in a corner of the Temple, and with a loud voyce call the people to prayer, singing prayers, composed for that purpose.</P>

and at the end of the world are not ignorant they are gui∣ded by their Lord, and shall be blessed. Misery is upon unbelievers. Whether thou reprove them, or do not re∣prove them, they will not be converted, God hath shut up their heart, their ears and eyes, and they shall suffer great torments.<NOTE PLACE="marg">See the Ex∣plication of <HI>Gelaldin.</HI></NOTE> Many men say, we believe in God, and the Day of Judgement, and do not believe; they think to deceive God, and them that believe in God; certainly they de∣ceive themselves, and know it not. God will augment the infirmity which they have in their heart, and they shall undergo the rigors of an infinite pain, by reason of their lying. When it was said to them; Pollute not the earth, they said, We are true observers of the Law of God; not∣withstanding, they were they that polluted the earth, but they knew it not. When it was said to them, Belieue ye as the world believeth? They said, Shall we believe as fools believe?<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Gelal∣din.</HI></NOTE> they themselves are fools, and know it not. When they met with such as believe in God, they said, we believe as you do: And when they returned towards the devils, their companions, they said, We believe as you, and mock at those men: Certainly God mocketh them, and conti∣nueth them in their Errors, to their confusion. They that have purchased Error, for the right way, have gained no∣thing in their commerce, and are not well directed; they are like to such as kindled fire, and when it hath enlighte∣ned what is about them, God hath deprived them of light, and left them in darkness, deaf, dumb, blind, and they shall never be converted; or as a cloud of Heaven, full of dark∣ness thunder, and lightning, they stopt their ears with their fingers, by reason of the noise, and for fear of death; but God seeth the unbelievers, he caused lightning to ap∣proach, that ravished from them their sight; they have fol∣lowed what appeared to them, and are detained in dark∣ness: But if God had pleased, he had deprived them, both of hearing, and sight; for he is omnipotent. O People! worship your Lord, who created you, and all that were be∣fore you; it may be, That you will fear him that hath ex∣tended the Earth, that raised the Heaven, and caused Rain to descend; that caused the production of Fruits to enrich

you. Say not, that God hath a companion equal to him, because you know the conttary. If you doubt that I have sent my servant, come, and bring some Chapters like to the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and call to witness the Idols that you adore; if you are good men, if you have not done it, or cannot perform it, Fear the fire of Hell prepared for Infid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls, and Idolaters; and declare to true believers, who do good works, That they shall enjoy the immense pleasures of Pa∣radise, wherein flow many Rivers; they shall there finde all sorts of faire and savory Fruits, which God hath pre∣pared for them; they shall consider, if they be like to such as they had before in the world: They shall there have wives, fair, and delicate, and shal dwel in eternall fe∣licity. God is not ashamed to compare a little <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Puny is a stink∣ing worm, frequently growing in Beds in hot Countries.</NOTE> Puny to an extream Greatness: Now, so it is, that true believers know, that it proceedeth from their Lord. The wicked demand, what God doth mean by that comparison? He by this means mis-leadeth, and directeth many men; but mis-leadeth none, but the disobedient. Such as pervert his Testament, and his Promises; such as retrench his Com∣mandements, and defile the Earth, are damned. Why will you be impious, seeing that God hath given you life after death? He will cause you to dye, he will raise you again, and you shall all return before him to be judged. He it is, that created whatever is upon Earth, and ascended to Heaven, hath ordained seven Heavens, knowing all things. Remember to instruct men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Kitab el tenoir.</HI></NOTE> that thy Lord said to his An∣gels, I would create a Vicar upon Earth; and when they answered, Wilt thou there place him that shall defile it, and shed blood, while we exalt thy Glory, and sanctifie thee; I know said he, what you know not. He taught <HI>Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> the names of all things, who discovered them to the An∣gels, to whom God said, Declare to me the names of all things that I have created, if you know them; they reply∣ed, Praise is due to thy Divine Majesty, we know nothing but what thou hast taught us, thou alone art knowing and wise. He said to <HI>Adam,</HI> Declare to them the names of all things that I have created. After he had taught them, God said, Did I not tell you, that I knew what is not,
<PB N="4" REF="14"/>
neither in Earth, nor Heaven; and that I understand whatever you make manifest, and whatever you keep most secret? Remember thou, that we said to the Angels, Hum∣ble your selves before <HI>Adam</HI>; they all humbled themselves, except the Devil: He was already proud, and in the num∣ber of the wicked. We said unto <HI>Adam,</HI> Dwell thou and thy wife in Paradise, and eat there what thou likest, but approach not that Tree, lest thou be in the number of the unjust. The Devil made them to sin, and depart from the Grace in which they were; then we said to them, Descend you enemies one to another, you shall have a dwelling up∣on Earth, and goods wherewith to live for a time. <HI>Adam</HI> begged pardon for his fault of his Lord, he pardoned him, because he is gracious and mercifull, and said, Descend, and go all of you out of Paradise; there shall hereafter come to you, a guide from me. Such as shall follow him, shall be delivered from fear and affl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction (at the day of Judgement;) such as shall be impious, and conceal my Commandements,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Alcoran in the old and new Testa∣ment.</NOTE> shall burn eternally in the fire of Hell. O children of <HI>Is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l,</HI> remember the Grace I have done you, I will satisfie my Promises, perform yours, fear me, and believe in what I have sent from Heaven, confirming what was before taught you; be not the first impious, and for∣sake not my Law at any rate; fear me, and cover not the Truth with a lye, neither willingly conceal it: Make your prayers at the time appointed, pay Tithes, and worship your Lord with them that adore him. Will you command people that have no care of their souls, to do good? Will you meditate upon Scripture, without observing it? En∣treat for succor with patience, and with prayers they a∣bound not, but in them th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t are obedient, that believe they shall one day behold their Lord, and shall return be∣fore him to be judged.

murthered your children, abused your wives; and that your Lord encreased your miseries, because of the enormity of your crimes. Remember, that we divided the Seas to save you, and that we drowned <HI>Pharaohs</HI> men in your view; ne∣verthelesse, you worshipped the Calf, when we detained <HI>Moses</HI> with us forty nights, in which you were extream∣ly too blame; after this, we pardoned you, it may be that you will give me thanks. We gave unto <HI>Moses</HI> the Book, that distinguisheth good from evill; perhaps you will be converted. Remember, that <HI>Moses</HI> said to his people,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gelaldin</HI> saith, the innocent slay the wicked.</NOTE> You were too blame for having adored the Calf; repent, and be converted to your Creator: Slay one another, that wil be a thing acceptable to God; he will pardon your crime, he is gracious and mercifull. You said, O <HI>Moses,</HI> we will not believe thee, for that we see not God; then you were smitten with thunder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We have pardoned you: See <HI>Gelaldin.</HI></NOTE> you saw your misery with your own eyes: nevethelesse, we raised you after your death; per∣haps you will give me thanks. We covered you with the shadow of clouds, we caused Manna and Quails to fall upon you, and said, Eat the good things we have given you. They did us no harm, when they murmured; they afflicted themselves. We said, Enter into that City,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gelaldin</HI> saith, it is <HI>Jerusalem</HI> See <HI>Kitab el tenoir.</HI></NOTE> and eat there∣in what shall content you; enter in at the gate, with hu∣mility, and say, Remove our sins from us.

You will not offend God in speaking a word in secret to women that you research in marriage, although you conceale in your mind your designe to espouse them, he understandeth what ever you thinke of them; know them not secretly, untill you have pronounced the words appointed by the Law; and enter not the bonds of marriage, untill the time set downe in writing be accomplished, God knoweth whatever is in your hearts: take heed unto your selves, he is gentle and gracious to them that feare him.

Fight for his Law, and know, that he understandeth and knoweth all things. Who is he that will afford him a good turne? He will augment him with multiplicity of increase; he giveth good, and taketh it away from whom it pleaseth him; you shall all returne before him to bee judged.

Such as in their heart incline to depart from the truth, doe often follow their inclination, desi∣rous of sedition, and to understand the explication of the <HI>Alcoran</HI>; but none understand its explication, but God, and such as are profound in learning; they say, we be∣lieve in God, all things proceed from his divine wisdome, neverthelesse none remember, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut the wise. Lord cause not our hearts to erre, after thou hast guided us into the right way, give us thy mercy, thou art most bountifull towards thy creatures. Lord thou art hee that shalt as∣semble the world at the day of Iudgement, at which day nothing shall be found doubtfull, when thou wilt not goe against thy promises, and when wealth and children shall not serve to the wicked, but to kindle the fire of Hell. The Infidell lineage of <HI>Pharoah,</HI> and those that preceded him, blasphemed and abjured the Law of God, but he surpri∣zed them in their sinne; hee is grievous in his chastise∣ments. Say to the Infidels, they shall be vanquished, and shall be gathered together into the fire of Hell, that is prepared for them. You have an example in the two Troops that fought for the glory of God, they beheld with their eyes, Infidels become true believers, like unto themselves; God strengthneth with his aide, whom it pleaseth him; this shall be for example to such as shall cleerly see. The love and desire of women, of children, of riches, abundance of gold, and of silver, of horses, cat∣tell, and of tillage, are pleasing to men; such are the ri∣ches of the life of this world, but the most assured refuge is in God. Say unto them; I will declare unto you things much better for them, that shall have the feare of God before their eyes: they shall dwell eternally in Paradise, where flow many rivers, with women beautifull, and leane, and all manner of content. God beholdeth them that a∣dore him, and that say, Lord we believe in thy Law, par∣don our sinnes, and deliver us from the torments of fire.

No in justice shall be done un∣to them. Say, Lord thou possessest the Kingdomes of the world, thou givest Royalty to whom thou seest good; from thy hand, oh Lord, proceedeth all good, thou art Om∣nipotent, thou causest day to enter the night, and night the day; thou causest life to come out of death, and death out of life; thou enrichest without measure whom thou seest good.

Then <HI>Zachary</HI> prayed to the Lord, and said, Lord give me a progenie that may bee pleasing to thee, and that may observe thy Commande∣ments; Lord heare my prayers.

Give unto orphans what appertaineth to them; and render not evill for good; devoure not their sub∣stance, it is a very great sin. If you feare to doe injury to Orphans, feare also to doe wrong to women; marry those that please you, two, three, or foure: if you appre∣hend you shall not be able to entertaine them equally; marry but one, or the slaves that you shall have acquired; this is most necessary, to the end you offend not God. Give to women their dowry with a good will; if they give to you any thing that is pleasing to you, receive it with affection, and civility. Bestow not on fools the wealth that God hath given you for subsistance; assist Orphans, give to them the garments that shall be necessary for them, and entertaine them honestly; instruct them untill they have attained to years of discretion, and are capable of mar∣riage; if you believe they demeane themselves wisely, re∣store to them their faculties, and devoure them not un∣justly

before they be of age. He that shall be rich, shall abstain from their goods, and he that is poore, shall take with honesty, according to the pains he shall undergoe for them: when you make to them restitution of their goods, take witnesse of your action, God loveth good ac∣counts. The children shall have a good part of what their father, and mother, and parents left after their decease, of little or of much there appertaineth to them a portion prefixed and limitted. When they divide their goods, the kindred shall have care of the poore and Orphans; doe good to them, and honestly entertaine them. Such as feare to leave after them a weak progeny of little chil∣dren, ought to feare to wrong Orphans, they must feare God, and courteously entertaine them. Those that un∣justly devoure their substance, swallow fire into their bowels, and shall burne in a great fire. God recommen∣deth to you your children, the son shall have as much as two daughters; if there be more then two daughters, they shall have two thirds of the succession of the dead; if there be but one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Bedaci.</HI></NOTE> she shall have the moity, and her kindred a sixth part of what shall be left by the dead: if there be no children, and the kindred be heires, the mother of the dead shall have a third; if there be brethren, the mo∣ther shall have a sixth, after satisfaction of the legacies contained in the Testament, and of debts. You under∣stand not to whom it is most requisite to doe good, to your children, or to your father and mother, give them their portion ordained of God. The moity of what their wives shall leave belongeth to you, if they have no children; if they have, you shall have the fourth part of what they shall leave, after payment of the legacies and debts: they shall have the fourth of your succession, if you have no children; if you have, they shall have the eighth por∣tion. If a man of woman be the heires of each other, and have neither father nor mother, nor children, and have a brother or sister, each of them shall have a sixth part of the succession; if they be more, they shall share the third, after payment of legacies and debts, without fraud, following what God hath ordained, he knoweth all your

actions, and is prudent in what he ordaineth, it is so or∣dained by his divine Maiesty. He that shall obey him, and his Prophet, shall enter into Paradise, where many rivers flow, and shall dwell in eternall felicity; he that shall disobey God and his Prophet, shall be cast head-long nto the fire of hell, where he shall suffer ignominious tor∣ments. If your wives commit adultery, take four witnesses of their fault, that be of your Religion; if they bear witness, keep them prisoners in your houses untill death, or untill God shall otherwise ordaine; punish whoremongers, concubines, and adulterers; if they repent of their fault, doe them no harme, God is gracious and mercifull to them that repent. Conversion dependeth on God, he is mercifull to them that commit sin ignorantly, and speedily repent, he is Omniscient, and most wise. Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣don is not for them that doe wickedly, to the very houre of their death, we have prepared great torments for them that shall die impious. O ye that believe in God! it is not lawfull for you to inherit what is your wives by force, take not violently away what you have given them, un∣lesse they be surprized in manifest adultery; see them with civility, if you have an avertion from them, it may chance that you hate a thing, wherein God hath placed much good; but if you desire to repudiate your wives, to take others, and that you have given them any thing, take not any thing that appertaineth to them. Wil you take their wealth with a lie and a manifest sin? How shall you take it, since you have approached each other, and that you have promised to use them civilly? Marry not the wives of your fathers; what is past was incest, abomination, and a wicked way. Your Mothers are forbidden you, your Daughters, Sisters, Aunts, Neices, your Nurses, and your foster-sisters, the mothers of your wives, the daugh∣ters that your wives have had by other husbands, of whom you shall have a particular care: The daughters of wo∣men that you shall have knowne, are also forbidden you; if you have not knowne them, it will be no sin: the wives of your sons are likewise prohibited, and two sisters; for what is past, God is gracious and mercifull: Married
<PB N="50" REF="36"/>
wives are likewise forbidden you, except the women slaves, that you shall have acquired. God hath so com∣manded you, except what is above forbidden, it is law∣full for you to marry at your pleasure. If you desire wo∣men for money, and neither commit concubinage, nor adultery, give them their salary for which you shall a∣gree, so you shall not offend God, he is omniscient, and most wise. He that shall not be able to espouse women of free-condition, shall marry such women or maids, that are slaves, as shall please him. God knoweth the faith of the one, and other. Marry your wives with the per∣mission of their parents, and give them their dowry with honesty: If women of free-condition, that have com∣mitted neither concubinage, nor adultery, secretly nor publikely, flie into second nuptials, and come to commit adultery, they shall be doubly punished, more then the daughters of Love.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Gelal∣din.</NOTE> The marriage of slaves is for them that fear whordom: If you abstain from marrying them, you shall not do amiss. God is gracious and mercifull; he is willing to teach you his Law, and direct you in the way of them that preceded you; he is gracious and mer∣cifull to his people. Such as follow the appetite of the wicked, decline extreamly from the Truth. God willeth that his Law be Light unto you, for that man was created weak. O you that believe in God, devour not your sub∣stance among you with ufury; but if you traffique, be peaceable in your affairs; slay not one another, God is mercifull to them that obey him: He that disobeyeth, through malice and iniustice, shall burn in the fire of Hell; it is an easie thing to God to punish them. If you depart from mortal sins, I will cover your faults, and cause you to enter into Paradise: covet not through envie, what God hath given to your neighbor; men and women shall have the wealth they have gained; beg Grace of God, he knoweth all things. Give to your associates what apper∣taineth to them. We have ordained a portion, prefixt to the one and the other, in the succession of your Father, Mother, and Kindred, God seeth all. The men shall have authority over the women; they shall have them in their
<PB N="51" REF="36"/>
keeping; they shall have in their power the wealth that God shall give them; and shall have care of what shall be convenient to be expended for them. Discreet and obe∣dient wives observe, in the absence of their husbands, the Commandements of God, make remonstrances to them that shall be disobedient, and remove them from your Bed, chastise them. If they obey you, seek not occasion to abuse them uniustly. God is most high, and most mighty. If you fear there may happen some difference between a man and his wife, send to them some of their Kindred, to put an end to their quarrel, and reconcile them. God wil give his peace to them, he is omniscient. Worship God, and say not that he hath a companion equall to him; do good to your Father, and Mother, your Kindred, Or∣phans, the Poor, your Neighbors, Pilgrims, your Friends, and your Slaves. God loveth not the proud. We have pre∣pared rigorous torments for them that are avaricious, that recommend avarice to the people, that conceal the Gra∣ces that God hath bestowed on them, and that are impi∣ous. Such as dispend their wealth with hypocrisie, be∣lieve neither in God, nor the day of Iudgement; and those that shall have the Devil for their companion, will be in exceeding bad company; he shall not approach them, if they believe in God, and the day of Iudgement, and give Alms in some part of the riches God hath given them. God knoweth them, and doth no iniustice to any one, of the weight of a small Ant. If the righteous do good of the quantity of a Pismire, God shall multiply it, and give them a great reward. In what condition will Infidels be at the day of Iudgement; for that we have witnesses of all Na∣tions against their impiety▪ and that we will call thee for a witnesse against them of their deportments? That day, the Infidels that have disobeyed the Prophet, shall def<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e to be consumed, like to the Earth; and not to have con∣cealed or altered, through their discourse, the Command∣ments of God. O you that believe, make not your pray∣ers, being drunk, untill you know what you speak; nei∣ther likewise being polluted, unless in passing on the way, untill you be cleansed; if you be in a iourney, or sick, or
<PB N="52" REF="37"/>
go to discharge your belly, or have known your wives and find no water to wash you, you shall lay hand upon the sand, and wipe your face and hands. God is graciou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and mercifull to his Creatures.

Such as blaspheme against God and his Pro∣phets, his Apostles; such as would make a distinction between the Commandements of his divine Majestie, and the precepts of his Prophets, such as affirme they be∣lieve in some of the Prophets, and believe not in all, and take a middle way betweene faith and impietie, are indeed impious, we have prepared for them ig∣nominious torments; but they who believe in God, and generally in all his Prophets, and Apostles, shall be re∣compenced of God, gracious and mercifull.

by reason of their impiety: They adored the Calfe, after having had the knowledge of our Commandements; ne∣verthelesse, we pardoned them, and gave to <HI>Moses</HI> an ab∣solute dominion over them. We raised the Mountain o∣ver them, following our promises, anh said to them; En∣ter the gate of the Temple with adoration and humility, and no longer transgress the observation of the day of Rest; We for this matter received from them a strong pro∣mise, but they swarved from what they had promised, and we cursed them, because of their impietie, by reason of the murther they committed-without reason, on the per∣sons of the Prophets, and of the words they uttered, <HI>viz.</HI> Our heart is hardned; Contrariwise, God imprinted in∣fidelitie in their hearts, they shall never believe in his Law, except very few of them, because of their malice, and the blasphemies they vomited against <HI>Mary:</HI> they said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chri∣stians.</NOTE> We have slain the Messiah, Jesus, the Son of <HI>Mary,</HI> the Prophet and Apostle of God: Certainly they flew him not, neither crucified him, they crucified one among them that resembled him; such as doubt it are in a ma∣nifest error, and speak not but through opinion. Cer∣tainly they flew him not; on the contrary, God took him up to himself, he is Omnipotent and prudent in all his actions: Such as have the knowledge of Scripture, ought to believe in Jesus before his death, he shall be a witnesse against them of their actions at the day of Judgement; We have prohibited them that Judaize, by reason of their sin, things that were permitted them; We have prepared for them great torment, because they mislead the world from the right way, because they take Use that is forbid∣den them, and unjustly eat the substance of their neigh∣bour. Such of them as are profound in Learning, and all the faithfull, believe in the Scriptures, both ancient, and modern; I will give great rewards to them that shall make their prayers at the time appointed, that shall pay Tithes, and believe in the day of Judgement. We have sent thee our inspirations, as we sent them to <HI>Noah,</HI> and the Prophets after him; as we heretofore sent them to <HI>Abraham, Ismael, Isaac, Iacob,</HI> the Tribes, to Jesus, <HI>Iob,

Ionas, Aaron,</HI> and to <HI>Solomon,</HI> and gave the Psalter to <HI>Da∣vid,</HI> We have told thee who were the Prophets that pre∣ceded thee; but we have not spoken to thee, concerning the merits of all them. <HI>Moses</HI> spake to God, as his Pro∣phet, and Apostle; all declared his mercy, and preached the torments of Hell, to the end men might have no cause of excuse; God is Omnipotent and prudent in all his a∣ctions: He shall be witnesse that the <HI>Alcoran</HI> was sent to thee with his Commandements, the Angels likewise testi∣fie it; but it ought to suffice thee, that God is witness. The Infidels that hindred the people to follow the Law of God, were exceedingly erroneous; God will not pardon them, he will lead them into the path of Hell, where they shall remain eternally, it is a thing easie to his divine Majestie. Oh people? A Prophet is come to you, who preacheth to you the Truth from the Lord, believe him, you shall do well; if you believe him not, know, that whatever is in Earth, and in Heaven is Gods, and that God knoweth whatsoever you do. Oh ye that understand the written Law! Obey the Commandements of God, and speak not of his divine Majestie but with truth; the Mes∣siah, Jesus, the Son of <HI>Mary,</HI> is a Prophet, and an Apostle of God, his Word, and his Spirit, which he sent to <HI>Mary</HI>; believe therefore in God, and in his Prophets, and say not there be three Gods, put an end to that discourse, you shall do well; For there is but one God, praysed be God, he hath no Son; what-ever is in Heaven, and in Earth o∣beyeth him, it is sufficient that he is witnesse. The Messi∣ah esteemeth it no dishonour to be the servant of God, neither the Angel, nor the Cherubins, He that holdeth it a dishonour to be at his service, is too proud; he shall as∣semble all the world at the day of Judgement, and every one shall receive the recompence that he shall have meri∣ted, he shall augment his favours upon them that shall have believed in his divine Majestie, and have done good works; he shall chastise them that shall have held it a dis∣honour to be his servants, and have been proud upon the Earth, they shall find no safe refuge but in his mercy. Oh people! God hath sent you a Protector, a most strong

argument, and a most cleare light; they that shall trust in God, shall enjoy his grace, and he shall guide them into the right way. They will enquire of thee concerning suc∣cessions; say to them, God teacheth you touching succes∣sions, as followeth; If a man decease without issue, and hath a sister, she shall have the moity of what he shall leave, and shall inherit it, if she have no children: If they be two sisters, they shall have two thirds of what the deceased left; if they be many brothers, and many si∣sters, the Sonne shall have as much as two daughters; God teacheth you his Commandemements, depart not from the right way, he is Omniscient.</P>

Say to them it is lawfull to eat all sorts of beasts that are not uncleane, and whatever hath been taught you from God, touching beasts that hath been wounded by Lions or Dogs, eat the beast you shall take, and remember God in blooding them; feare God, he is exact to take account.

manifest. God hath sent you a Book full of light, to con∣duct into the way of Salvation them that love him, to bring them out of darknesse, and by his speciall grace, to lead them into the way of Salvation. Certainly he that saith, that the Messiah, the Sonne of <HI>Mary,</HI> is God, is im∣pious: Say to him who can hinder God to exterminate the Messiah, and his Mother, with whatsoever is in the Earth, when it shall seeme good to him? God is King of Heaven and earth, he created with them what seemed good to him, he is Omnipotent. The Jews and Christians have said, we are the Children of God, his wel-beloved; Say to them, shall not God chastise you for your sinnes? Cer∣tainly ye are men; He that created you, pardoneth, and punisheth as it pleaseth him, he is the King of all that is in Heaven or Earth, and of whatever is betweene them, he is the refuge of the righteous. O ye that have know∣ledge in the written Law! The Poophet, the Apostle of God is come to instruct you in a time that there is none other Prophet but hee on the Earth; Will you say that no man preached to you the torments of Hell? Cer∣tainly the word of God is this day preached to you, the torment of Hell, and the Omnipotencie of his Divine Majestie. Remember thou what <HI>Moses</HI> said to his people, Oh people, call to mind the grace of God towards you, he hath chosen from among you Prophets, and Kings, hath conferred on you what he hath given to none in the world: Enter into the holy Land, as God hath comman∣ded, turne not your backs to your enemies, lest you be in the number of Reprobates: They answered, oh <HI>Moses</HI>! there are Gyants and Tyrants in the Holy Land, we will not enter into it, untill they be gone out of it, if they for∣sake it, we will enter into it. Then two men of them that were in the grace of God, said to them, enter at the gate, and fight against them, you shall be victorious, trust in God, if you believe in his Law: They said, oh <HI>Moses</HI>! we will not enter, so long as those Tyrants dwell therein, goe and fight against them with thy Lord, we will here attend. Then said <HI>Moses,</HI> Lord, I dispose but of mine own, and my brothers person; separate us from this wicked

people; the Lord said to him, the entrance into the Ho∣ly Land is prohibited to this people, they shall wander forty years upon the Earth, in confusion and amazement, afflict not thy selfe with the deportments of the wicked; teach them the Historie of the Sonnes of <HI>Adam,</HI> how they offered sacrifices, how the sacrifice of the one was accep∣ted that of the other was not: he through envie menaced his brother, to murther him; his brother said to him, God receiveth the sacrifices, and holocausts of such as have his feare before their eyes: assuredly if thou exten∣dest thine hand to slay me, I will not stretch forth mine to hurt thee; I feare the Lord of the Universe; If thou chargest thy selfe with the murther of my person, with thy past sinnes, thou shalt goe to hell, where the unjust shall be punished: The murther of his brother seemed easie and advantagious for him, he slew him, and is in the number of the Damned. God sent a Raven that made a pit in the Earth, and shewed him the manner to bury the body of his brother: Then said he, would to God I had been weake and impotent, that I were like to this Raven? I must bury the body of my brother, and he was penitent for his offence; by reason of this murther, we ordained to the children of Israel, that he who shall slay a person innocent, shall be punished, as if he had slaine the whole world, and he that shall give him his life, shall be recompensed, as if hee had given life to the whole world. My Prophets came to the Children of Israel, taught them my Commandements, and caused them to see Miracles, neverthelesse many of them were disobedient? the punishment of them that oppose the will of God, that of his Prophet, and that endeavour to pollute the earth, is to be slain, hanged, to have the right foot, and the left hand, or right hand, and the left foot cut off, and to bee extirpated from the earth; they shall have in this world shame on the forehead, and shall feele in the other, great torments, except such as shall be converted before their death, and shall know, that God is gracious and merci∣full. Oh ye that believe! feare God, fight for his Law, you perhaps shall be happy. All the Treasures of the world

shall not bee able to redeeme Infidels at the day of Judgement, they shall endure exceeding great torments, they shall desire to goe out of the fire of Hell, but shall dwell there eternally. Cut off the hands of those men and women that steale, they contract upon themselves the wrath of the world, and the punishment that God hath prepared for the wicked: He that shall turn, and do good works, shall be pardoned, God is gracious and mercifull to the penitent. Knowest thou not that the Kingdome of Heaven, and of Earth is Gods? that hee chastiseth and pardoneth whom it pleaseth him? and that he is Omni∣potent? Oh Prophet! afflict not thy selfe, to behold them running to impietie; that say with the mouth, we be∣lieve, and have no faith in their hearts; neither for them that Judaize, and hearken to the lies of their Doctors, to relate them to others; they pervert the language of the Old Testament, and say; If you be instructed in those precepts, you ought to observe them, if they instruct you not in them, take heed to your selves. Such as make use of the name of God, to move the people to sedition, are without faith, God will not purifie their hearts, they shall have in this world shame upon the forehead, and feele in the other extreame torments. They listen to blasphemies, and eat what is prohibited; If they repaire to thee, and submit themselves to thy judgement, judge their contro∣versie with equity, converse not with them; if thou de∣part from their company, they shall not hurt thee, if thou givest judgement between them, Judge with equitie, God loveth the just: How shall they submit to thy judgement, seeing they have the Old Testament, which containeth the Commandements of God? They will not execute thy Judgement, neither believe in the Old Testament, where∣is the guide of the right way, and a light to the Prophets, to judge the differences arising among true believers, a∣mong Jews; their Doctors, and ther Priests, who study the Scripture, and are witnesses that it containeth the truth, feare not the world, but dread me; sell not, neither exchange my commandements for any price. Such as judge not conformably to the Law of God, are Infidels;

We have ordained the <HI>Talio,</HI> man for man, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an eare for an eare, a tooth for a tooth, a wound for a wound; he that shall observe it, shall do well, and such as shall not judge conformably to the Law of God are unjust. We sent after many Prophets, Je∣sus the Son of <HI>Mary,</HI> who confirmed the ancient Scrip∣tures, to him we gave the Gospel, full of light, to conduct the people to the right way, with a confirmation of the Old Testament, a guide and instruction for the righteous. They that follow the Gospel, ought to judge as it is com∣manded in the Gospel; such as judge not conformably to what God hath taught them, are disobedient to his di∣vine Majesty. To thee have we sent the Book that con∣taineth the truth, and confirmeth the antient Scriptures, determine the differences that shall arise among the people, as I have inspired thee, and follow not the appe∣tite of men that will abjure the truth which I have taught thee. We have instructed all of you in a Law, and assured means to lead you into the way of Salvation; you should all have been of one and the same Religion, had it so pleased God; he hath done this to prove you; Doe good, and know, that you all shall be assembled before him, and he shall resolve the doubts that are among you. If thou judgest the differences that are among them, judge com∣formably to what hath been inspir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d into thee, and follow not their appetites; be carefull they seduce thee not, and move thee to doubt many things that God hath taught thee; if they disobey his Commandements, know, he will severely punish them, because of the enormity of their crimes. The greatest part of the world are impious; Do they affect the Judgement of the Ignorant? What better Judge for the good, is there then God? O ye that believe! obey not the Jews, nor the Christians, they mutually obey each other in their impietie, he that shall obey them, shall be like unto them, God guideth not the unjust. Thou seest such as are unstable in their Faith, flock to them, and say, they fear a change of times, but God shall give advantage and victory to his Prophet, and they shall repent to have concealed in their mindes the Miracles of his divine Ma∣jestie.
<PB N="71" REF="46"/>
What will they alleadge for excuse, who swore by the name of God, exactly to observe their Religion, and to be with you? Their good works shall be unprofitable, and they in the number of the Damned. Oh ye that be∣lieve! if you abandon your faith, God will put others in your place, that shall love him, and he them, and this to your great ignominie, and the advantage of converted In∣fidels, that shall fight without fear, for his Law: Thus God bestoweth his grace, as he seeth good, he is liberall, and Omniscient. You ought certainly to obey God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Gelal∣din.</HI></NOTE> and his Prophet, his Apostle; they who believe in God, that make their prayers at the time appointed, pay tithes, and are in the protection of God and his Prophet, shall be be∣loved of his divine Majestie, and be victorious. Oh ye true believers! obey not such as scoffe at your Religion, who have knowledge of the written Law; obey not Infi∣dels, and if you are good men, fear God; obey not them that deride your prayers, it is the action of those that are unwise. Oh ye that understand the written Law! will you not abhorre me, if I believe not in God, in what he hath inspired into me, and into them that preceded me? The greatest part of you are wicked. Say to them, Did I in∣struct you to do evill, when I preached to you the effect of Gods mercy? Those whom he curseth, against whom he is incensed, whom he hath metamorphised into Apes, and Swine, and who have adored Idols, shall be confined in the fire of Hell, they are in a very evill way. When they come to thee, they will say, they believe in the Law of God, they will enter thine house with impiety, and goe forth in the like manner, but God knoweth what they con∣ceale in their heart: Thou shalt see many of them em∣brace Paganisme, follow a lye, eat what is forbidden, and this to displease their Doctors, and Priests, who have for∣bidden them to speak lies, and eat meats that are unclean. The Jews said, the hand of God is shut, contrariwise, it is their hand that is shut, and they shall be accursed by reason of their discourse: certainly the hands of God are open, and he doth good to whom he pleaseth: Many a∣mongst them, through impietie, and disobedience, alter
<PB N="72" REF="47" MS="y"/>
what is in the Scripture; but we have cast among them hatred, and horror, even to the day of Judgement, God hath extinguished the fire which they had kindled, to make warre against the righteous; they endeavour to pollute the earth, but God detesteth such as cause disor∣der; he remitteth their sinnes that know the Scripture, believe in his Law, and flie impiety, they shall enter Pa∣radise, that is full of delights. They have read the Old Testament, the Gospel, and all Scriptures, they enjoyed abundance of all good things; neverthelesse many have disobeyed the Commandements of God. Oh Prophet! preach what God hath taught thee; whether thou dost preach it, or doest not, he will defend thee from the ma∣lice of men, he abhorreth Infidels. Oh ye that know the written Law! if you observe not the Old Testament, the Gospel, and Scriptures which God hath sent you, you shall be without merit. Many of them through impiety and ignorance, pervert what is contained in the Scrip∣ture; afflict not thy self with the actions of the impious. The Jews, Samaritans, Christians, all that shall have be∣lieved in God, the Resurrection of the dead, and have done good works, shall be exempt from affliction, there is nothing for them to feare at the day of Judgement.<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Kitab el tenoir.</HI></NOTE> We received of the Children of Israel a promise, to believe in our Prophets, and Apostles; Yet have they slandred ma∣ny, and slain such as would not follow their appetites: they believed there was no punishment for their crimes, and became deafe, and blinde; After this, God pardoned them, neverthelesse, they returned in their sin, and are again become deaf, and blinde; God beholdeth all their deportments. Certainly, they who affirme the Messiah, the Son of <HI>Mary,</HI> to be God, are impious; the Messiah commanded the Children of Israel to worship God, his and their Lord; the entrance into Paradise is forbidden to him that shall say, God hath a companion equall to him, Hell shall be his habitation, and the unjust shall finde none to protect them at the day of Judgement. Such as affirm there are three Gods, are impious: there is but one God; if they defist not from such discourse, they shall
<PB N="73" REF="47" MS="y"/>
burn in the fire of Hell; if they turn, and implore pardon of God, he will be to them gracious and mercifull. The <HI>Messiah,</HI> the Son of <HI>Mary,</HI> is a Prophet, and Apostle of God, like to the Prophets that came before him; his Mo∣ther is holy, and both of them did eat and drink. Consi∣der how I manifiest my unitie to Infidels; how they blas∣pheme, and depart from the Truth; say to them, Will you worship in stead of God, what can neither benefit, nor hurt you? God understandeth and knoweth all things. O ye that have knowledge of the written Law! speak of your Religion with reverence, and follow not the appe∣tites of such as go astray, and walk in an evill way. The Infidels were accursed by the tongue of <HI>David,</HI> and of <HI>Messiah,</HI> the Son of <HI>Mary,</HI> because of their disobedience; they abstain not from things that are not approved; they do them, and through obstinacy will continue them. Thou shalt see many of the Inhabitants of <HI>Mecca</HI> adhere to them, by reason of the sin they conceale in their hearts. God assuredly will be incensed against them, and they shall be confined eternally in the torments of Hell. If they had believed in God, in his Prophet, and the Scriptures, they had not obeyed Infidels, but many of them are impi∣ous. Thou shalt finde the Jews, and Inhabitants of <HI>Mec∣ca,</HI> who believe in many Gods, to be very great enemies to the faithfull, and the Christians to have a great in∣clination, and amity towards the True-believers; for that they have Priests, and Religious, that are humble, who have eyes full of tears, when they hear mention of the Doctrine which God hath inspired into thee, because of their knowledge of the Truth, and say, Lord, We believe in thy Law, write us in the number of them that profess thy Unity, who hindreth us to believe in God, and the Truth wherein we have been instructed? We desire with passion, O Lord, to be in the number of the jest. God shall hearken to their prayer, and pardon them; he shall open to them the gate of Paradise, wherein is the reward of the righteous, and the Infidels shall inhabit the abyss of Hell. Oh ye who are True-believers! inh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bit not the eating of what God hath permitted, offend not God, hee

Oh ye that believe in God! Wine, Games of hazard, Idols, Lots, and divinations are abo∣minations, and filthy practises of the Devill, depart from him, perhaps you will be righteous. The Devill desireth to fow among you dissention, and horrour, through wine, and games of hazard, to choak your remembrance of God, and of praying to him; abandon wine, and games of ha∣zard, be obedient to God, and the Prophet, his Apostle, and take heed to your selves; If you disobey God, know that the Prophet is obliged only to preach publiquely the word of his divine Majesty; the True-believers, and the righteous have not provoked God in drinking wine, and playing at games of hazard, before they were prohibited, they will abstaine for the future, and performe good works, God loveth them that do good. Oh ye that be∣lieve! God proveth you by one thing, to wit, by hunting, whether you take the game with your hands, or coursing on horse-back, to discerne them among you that fear him, and believe in his Law; whosoever shall offend him, shall be severely punished. Oh ye that believe! kill not your game, during the time of your pilgrimage to <HI>Mecca</HI>; whosoever shall kill of deliberate purpose, shall be judged, as if he had slain his Neighbours beast, he shall be judged by one among you, and be con∣demned to offer a present at the Temple of <HI>Mecca,</HI> or to give food to the poore, or to fast, or performe somewhat of like nature, for the expiation of his errour; if he have

If you doubt their integrity, cause them sweare to be faithfull in their testi∣monies, and not give themselves to be corrupted by your kindred. Conceale not your testimony, lest you be in the number of sinners. If you discover those two witnesses to have erred in their testimonie, substitute two other in their place, although they partake in your succession, and take oath of them to be more veritable in their dispositi∣ons, then the two others, otherwise they will offend God, and be numbred with the unjust. It is better to speake Truth, then to be in feare, lest your falshood be detected; feare God, and hearken to his Commandements, he gui∣deth not them that disobey him. He shall one day assem∣ble his Prophets and Apostles, and say unto them, what did you answer, being questioned concerning my unity? they shall reply, Lord, we are ignorant, thou alone know∣est all things.

Then said he, Oh God my Lord, cause to descend upon us from Heaven a Table covered with meat, this day shall be celebrated by us and them that shall succeed, this shall be a signe of thy omni∣potency; enrich us with thy grace, thou possessest all treasure. God said to him, I will cause to descend from Heaven the food which thou desirest, and whosoever shall be impious, shall be punished with torments, that no man yet hath suffered.

a prefixed time for your death, and resurrection; neverthelesse you doubt, he is God in Heaven and in Earth, he understandeth the secrets of your hearts, and whatsoever you make manifest; he knoweth the good and evil that you commit, that his Commandements have been taught the Inhabitants of <HI>Mecca,</HI> and that they have abju∣red them; they opposed the revealed Truth, but shall be chastised for their contempt, They consider not how much people we have destroyed, in past ages; we gave them pla∣ces to dwell in,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Gelal∣din.</HI></NOTE> more strong and spacious then those which you inhabit, sent them about of raine, caused fountaines flow in the places of their habitation; after this did we extirpate them, by reason of their sins, and established in their place a new people. We have sent to thee the Scrip∣ture, written in Vellam, the unbelievers have handled it with their hands, yet say, it is evident sorcery and enchant∣ment, that they will not believe therein, unless they see an Angel descend, to confirme it. Should we have sent an An∣gel, they had perished by his presence, unless we had sent him under the Figure of a man, like unto them, and cloa∣thed as they are. They derided the Prophets, and Apostles, thy Predecessors; derision is fallen upon such as contemned them. Say to them, goe through the world, and consider the end of them that abjure the Law of God; say to them, to whom appertaineth whatsoever is in Heaven and earth? it is Gods. He will employ his mercy to save you; doubtlesse he will assemble all of you at the day of Judge∣ment. Neverthelesse Infidels believe not in his Unity; they consider not, that whatsoever moveth by night, and by day, and whatsoever is in the world, belongeth to his Divine Majesty, who understandeth and knoweth all things. Say to them, require you other protection then that of God the Omnipotent, Creator of heaven and earth, who nourisheth all things, is nourished by none? Say to them, I have received a command to embrace the Law of Salvation. Be not ye in number of unbelievers; I feare to disobey my Lord, and feare the torments pre∣pared for the wicked at the day of Judgement; he that shall deliver himselfe, shall enjoy the grace of God,

which is supreame felicity: If God will punish you, none shall deliver you from his punishment; if his Will be to doe good to you, he is Omnipotent, alwayes victo∣rious, and hath all power over his Creatures; he is most wise and Omniscient. Say to them, What better testi∣mony is there in the world then that of God? Say to them, He shall testifie between you and me, to whom he hath inspired the <HI>Alcoran</HI> to instruct you: Will any among you that shall learn it, say there is any other God, but God; I will not say so; there is but one God, and I am innocent from the sin you commit, in associating him with a companion equall to him; many of them that understand the written Law, have knowledge of the truth of the <HI>Alcoran</HI>; their children also know it, but such as forsake their owne souls, will not believe in God. Who more unjust, then he that blasphemeth a∣gainst God and his Commandements? Certainly the wic∣ked shall be miserable; I will assemble all of them, and say, where are the gods which you did associate with God? They shall have none other excuse, but to say, by God, Lord, we were of the number of Idolaters. Consider how they will lie, and disavow their blasphemies: some there be among them that hearken to thee, we have hardened their hearts, they will not learne the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> because their ears are stopped. When they shall heare related all the miracles of the world, and shall see them with their eyes, they will not believe untill they have disputed against thee. The wicked say the <HI>Alcoran</HI> is but a lie, and Fable of Antiquity; they forbid the people to believe it, and con∣temne it; certainly they destroy their souls, and know it not; thou shalt see when they shall be detained in the fire of hell, they will say, would to God I might return into the world, I would obey the Commandements of his divine Majesty, &amp; be in the number of true believers. They knew the truth, but conceal'd it; should they return into the world they would return to their impiety, they are liars. They af∣firm, there is none other life then that of the world, neither any resurrection; when they shall be before God, they shal acknowledge their errors, he shall cause them to feele the

Such as believe not in the resurrection, are wretched men, they shall be afflicted for their sins at the houre when ever death shall surprize them; they shall bear on their back the burthen of their crimes, and avouch the life of this world to be but deceit and vanity, and the life of the other to be full of fe∣licity for the righteous;<NOTE PLACE="marg">O <HI>Maho∣met.</HI></NOTE> neverthelesse the wicked are not converted. I know thou wilt be incensed against such as shall say, they desire to obey thee, and shall renounce thy Doctrine; they that contemne the Commandements of God are impious, they have belied the Prophets thy Prede∣cessors; the Prophets endured their lies, and were patient, untill we destroyed them; God declineth not what he hath promised. Thou knowest what the Prophets foretold: if men abandon thee, canst thou covet to continue on earth (to instruct them) and to be in heaven at the same time, to cause prodogies appear (testimonies of thy mission.) Had it so pleased God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Gelal∣din.</HI></NOTE> he had brought them all into the right way, nor had they been in the number of the igno∣rant.

They have said, we believe not in the Pro∣phet, if he shew not to us some miracle from his Lord: say unto them, God hath shewed you many miracles, but most of you doe not understand them; the beasts that walk up∣on the Earth, and the birds that flie in the Aire, are in the number of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s cre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tures: We have not omitted to write any thing that is writt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Book kept in heaven; all men shall one day appear before God, such as shall not have believed in his Law, shall be deaf and dumb, and in∣habit darkenesse: God misleadeth whom it pleaseth him, and guideth in the right way whom he seeth good.

If you implore him, he will deliver you f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om the evils that you feare; and if it please him, you shall abandon the Idols, which with unbelievers you adore. We sent our Prophets to

them that were before you, when they contemned them, we sent afflictions to procure their conversion, which had not been done without the miseries that we brought up∣on them. Nevertheles their heart is hardned, the devill caused them to find disobedience more advantagious, and they forgot what was taught them. When we opened the gate of happinesse, they exceedingly rejoyced, and were ingratefull; but when they thought least of it, they were chastised, became desperate, and were extirpated for the great glory of God; Lord of the Univers, say unto them, if God rendred you deaf, blind, and ignorant, what o∣ther god then God shall restore your sight, hearing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">O <HI>Maho∣met.</HI></NOTE> and knowledge? Consider how I manifest my Unity; never∣thelesse they will not believe it, say unto them, have, you had a sense of the scourge of God secretly and publikely? Hath God condemned any but the wicked? He sent not the Prophets and Apostles, but to proclaime the felicity of Paradise, and preach the torments of Hell: He that shall believe, and doe good works, shall be exempt from feare at the day of Judgement, and unbelievers shall be puni∣shed, because of their disobedience: Say unto them, I told you not that I had in my power all the treasures of God, neither that I had knowledge of the future, and past; nor doe afirme, that I am an Angell, I only act what hath been inspired into me; is the blind like to him that seeth clearly?

you, that shall offend him through ignorance that shall repent of his error, and doe good works, he is benigne and mercifull. Thus doe I recount the graces of God, and discover the way of sinners; Say unto them, I am forbid∣den to worship what you adore, lest I should goe astray from the right way. I have received from God a light, which yee have contemned; God is Judge of all things, judgeth with truth, and is most just in his Judgements. I cannot forthwith give you a sight of the torments of hell, neither of the chastisement of God, which you with so much instance require; this dependeth on his divine Ma∣jesty; had I this power, our difference would be soon at a period. God knoweth the unjust, in his power are the keys of the future, none knoweth but he; he knoweth whatsoever is in the earth, and the sea, the number of the leaves that fall from the trees, and of the atomes that are in the dark∣nesse of the earth. There is nothing dry or greene in the earth, that is not written in the Book of Light. He it is that causeth you to die in the night, and knoweth the good and evill that you have committed by day; he shall cause you to rise againe at the day nominated; you all shall ap∣peare before him, he shall give you knowledge of your sins, and shall chastise you after your demerits; he is al∣wayes victorious and omnipotent. He shall send to ob∣serve your actions; and when you shall arrive at the hour of death, he shall dispatch his messengers, who shall not faile to execute his commands; the people shall repaire to him, as to their Lord, he is extreamly exact to keep ac∣count. Say unto them, he shall deliver you from the dark∣nesse of the sea, and of the earth; when you shall in secret, or publikely invoke him; if he deliver me, I will returne him thanks for his grace: Say unto them, God can de∣liver you from darkenesse, and all other afflictions; yet say you, he hath a companion associate with him: Say unto them, we can send punishments from above, and from below; he is able to disunite, and cause you to tast a thousand miseries, which you shall bring upon each other. Consider how I shew them the effects of my Omnipotency; they will peradventure comprehend my sayings: Those of

thy Nations have rejected them, notwithstanding they are most true: say unto them, I am not your Tutor; every thing hath its time, you shall hereafter understand the truth. Depart from them that speake of our Law with contempt, untill he speak otherwise; the devill would in∣duce thee to forget my Commandements, and cause thee to sit down with the unjust: the true believers shall not regard their discourse, neither cease to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dmonish them, peradventure they will be converted. Depart thou from such as sport and mock at their Religion, the wealth of this world rendreth them haughty; declare, they shall be se∣verely punished; none is able to protect or hear them but God, no ransome is able to deliver them; they shall find the good and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vill that they have committed, shall drink a liquor extreamly cold, and endure grievous torments, because of their impiety; say unto them, shall we worship instead of God, what can neither benefit nor hurt us? Shall we return on our steps to our sins, having been guided by his divine Majesty, like unto him whom the devill hath seduced? He left him dismaid, and astonished in the midst of his voyage, having forsaken his companions, that shew∣ed him the right way. God guideth men to the way of Sal∣vation I will wholly resigne my self to the pleasure of his divine Majesty: Make your prayers at the time appointed, and pay tithes, you all shall appear before God at the day of Judgement, to give account of your actions.

I feare not your Idols, my God doth what pleaseth him, and knoweth all things, will you not consider it? How shall I feare your Idols, since you are not afraid to affirme, that God hath companions equall to him, which you have no reason to adore? If you understand the truth, who is more true, you, or I?

If they slander them that have know∣ledge of the Scriptures, and of Prophesies, will give power over their persons to men that shall mislead them with the Infidels: Those whom God guideth, believe in the Unity of his divine Majesty.

they understood not his graces, when they said, he hath instructed the people in nothing that is profitable. Say unto them, who gave the Tables unto <HI>Moses?</HI> who instru∣cted him in the Scripture, which they have written in Vellam, to guide and illuminate the people? They have published what pleaseth them, and have concealed much; they shall learn in the <HI>Alcoran</HI> what they know not, and what their fathers understood not: Say to them, God af∣ter that left them obstinate, and amazed in their errors. We have sent from heaven that Book full of blessedness, it confirmeth the Scriptures that were sent before it, to the end thou maist instruct the people of <HI>Mecca,</HI> them that in∣habit about that City, and the rest of the world. Such as shall believe in the day of Judgement, believe in what is written in this Book, and shall pray to God to deliver them from the torments of hell: Who is more unjust then he that blasphemeth against God? that saith, God hath inspired into him what he uttereth, notwithstanding he hath received no inspiration from his Divine Maje∣stie. Who more unjust, then he that saith, he will cause to discend from heaven, things like to those which God inspired into his Prophets? When thou shalt see the wic∣ked at the point of death, and the Angels stretching forth their hands to take their souls: say unto them, This day the torments of hell shall be the punishment of the blas∣phemies that ye have vomited against God, and your diso∣bedience to his Commandements. God shall say to them, you are come before us without riches, and children, na∣ked as you were created, and have cast behind your backs the instructions which we gave you; I see not with you the Idols you adored; you are separated from each o∣ther, and have forsaken them, that you esteemed on earth, should have been your protectors; God separateth the good from the wicked, as the corn from the ear, and the stone from the Date: He causeth the living to spring from the dead, and the dead from the living: behold the works of God; why will you depart from his Law? He divi∣deth the morning from darkness, hath established night for the repose of men, and the Sun and Moon to compute

ages, years, moneths, and seasons; such are the effects of Gods power, he is Omnipotent, and knoweth all things. He it is that created the Stars to give you light, and guide you in the obscurity of the earth and sea; he gratifieth with his grace, and such as learn his Commandements. He it is that created you of one sole person, that gave you the earth to inhabit, and preserveth you in the world, hee hath conferred his grace on such as have obeyed his Com∣mandements, hath made raine to descend from heaven, and caused the earth to produce divers sorts of herbs, green things, and corn; he hath caused the Date to spring forth, and the Palme tree, with gardens enriched with Grapes, Olives, Pomgranets, and many fruits alike, and different. Consider how fruits encrease and multiply; this serveth for instruction of Gods Unity, to them that have his fear before their eyes: the Infidels have adored the devill, with God, who created them, and said, that God hath sons and daughters, such is their ignorance; praised be God, he created heaven and earth; how shall he have a son, who hath no wives? He created and know∣eth all things, he is your God, and your Lord, there is none other God but he; worship him, he conserveth all things, he is seen of no man, and beholdeth all things, he is benigne, and nothing is concealed from him. O peo∣ple, there is come to you a light from your Lord to con∣duct you, he that seeth clearly shall receive advantage; and he that shall be blinde, shall continue his miserie; I am your Tutor, neither observe I what you do; Thus do I declare the mysteries of my Law, the wicked shall in the end confesse that thou hast taught my Commande∣ments to such as inclined to learn them.

They have sworn by the name of God to fight for the faith, if some miracle appeare to instruct them; miracles proceed from God, they know not the time wherein he will make them to appeare; although they should see miracles, they will not be converted.

through their sinnes, I converted them, and gave them a light to illuminate them, in the darknesse, wherein Infi∣dels shall dwell for ever, because they delight in their disobedience: Thus will I place in every City, leaders, that shall seduce the wicked, and themselves, but shall not understand it: When they beheld any signe (of the truth of the Prophet) appeare; they said, they will not believe in him, unlesse he were accompanied with the vertues, and merits of other Prophets; God maketh choyce of them on whom he conferreth the grace of prophecie, he shall chastise such as discourse in that manner, with igno∣minie in this world, and they shall feel in the other great torments, by reason of their impietie. God rejoyceth the hearts of them that he inclineth to lead into the way of Salvation, and punisheth them that digresse from the right path; his wrath fell upon the Infidels so soon as he as∣cended into Heaven. The way thou followest is the right way; we have recompensed such as have understanding to profit, they shall be happy, God shall be their prote∣ctor, because of their good works. Remember thou the day wherein we shall assemble the people, and when it shall be said to the Devils, Oh ye bands of Devils! where∣fore are you risen against men?

Oh ye Bands of men and Devils! have you not seen my Prophets, and Apostles of your own Nation, who have given you to see Miracles? who have preached my Commandements, and the day of Judgement? They shall answer, they have seen the Pro∣phets, and Apostles, but that the life of the world ren∣dred them proud, and shall confesse themselves to have been wicked. God shall not destroy <HI>Mecca</HI> for the inju∣stice therein committed, untill he hath sent an Apostle to

the Inhabitants, to teach them his Commandements; e∣very one shall be punished according to his works, thy Lord knoweth whatsoever is done in the world. Hee hath no need of his people, he is altogether mercifull, he can destroy you if it please him, and establish in your place another people, as he hath established you in the place of your predecessors. If you be not converted, you shall not escape the torments of Hell; Say unto them, do as you understand him, I will comport my selfe, as I shall apprehend him; you shall in the end understand who shall have the good part in the other world. None shall give succour to Idolaters, they, they offer to their Idols of the fruits that God hath created, and say, (following their thoughts) behold our God! Such sacrifices ascend not to God, their Idolatrie hath induced many of them to sacri∣fice their own Children to their false Gods, they have de∣stroyed them, and were ensnared in their Religion; which they had not done, had it so pleased God; Separate thy selfe from them and their blasphemies they have said, that the fruits of the earth, and the benefits of God were un∣clean, and would not eat of them. God giveth food but to those whom he is pleased to gratifie. They have prohi∣bited to ride on some beasts that God gave them, and slew them for food, without pronouncing the name of his di∣vine Majestie, which is a great sin, but they shall be puni∣shed according to their demerits, They have said it is law∣full for men to eat what is in the bellies of beasts, and that it is unlawfull for their wives, and when they had slain them, they did eat for company; but God shall chastise them for their discourse, he is most wise, and Omniscient. Such as slay their Children are wretched men, fooles and ignorant, they have forbidden to eat the good things that God hath given them, to blaspheme, and are gone astray from the right way. It is God who created the gardens full of fruits, and herbs of divers colours, with Olives, Pomegranets, and other fruits alike, and different: Eat of the fruits of the Earth: Pay the due, appointed when you reap, and dispense not your substance lightly; God ab∣horreth prodigals: Of clean beasts, some there be that
<PB N="90" REF="56"/>
have borne the burden, and others that are young, and have not borne it; Eat what God hath given you, and follow not the foot-steps of the Devill, he is your open e∣nemie. Say unto them, behold eight paire of beasts, <HI>viz.</HI> two paire of Weathers,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Kitab el tenoir.</NOTE> two of Ewes, two of Camels, and two paire of Cowes, of which is it permitted, or forbidden you to eat? Is it lawfull for you to eat the males, or fe∣males? Which are those that God hath forbidden you? Who is more wicked then he that blasphemeth, to seduce from the right way the people that are ignorant? God guideth not the unjust; Say unto them, In all that God hath inspired into me, I finde not that it is prohibited to eat of those beasts, except they die of some disease, and if they be slain without pronouncing the name of God. The flesh of Swine is forbidden you; if you eat of it, you in∣curre the wrath of God; If any one be in necessity, and eateth without designe to provoke God, he shall find God gracious and mercifull. We forbad the Jews to eat of beasts whose feet were cloven, and of the fat of Beasts, ex∣cept of such as is interlarded in the flesh, the entrails and the bones. We enjoyned this prohibition by reason of their sinne, and we are veritable in our words, and exact in our promises: If they slander thee, Say unto them, the mercy of God is great, and the wicked shall not avoid the punishment of their crimes. The Infidels have said, had it pleased God, we had not been unbelievers, neither our fathers also, and nothing had been prohibited. Their pre∣decessors spake as they, untill they felt the punishment of their sins. Say unto them, Are you assured that God is content with your proceeding? Tell us, whence ariseth this assurance? You, in this, follow but your opinion, you are but lyers, Gods providence is great; he had guided all of you in the right way, had it so pleased him. Cause them come before us, who said, It is unlawfull to eat of clean Beasts; were they present when God made the Pro∣hibition? If they say they were present, say not as they, Neither follow the appetites of blasphemous Infidels, who believe not in the end of the word, and worship many Gods. Say unto them, Come, I will instruct you what is
<PB N="91" REF="56"/>
by God forbidden to be eaten; there is but one sole God, say not, he hath companions equal to him; do good to your Father and Mother, and slay not your children, in fear of dying with famine, God shall bestow on you and them also, what shall be necessary; commit not whore∣dome, either privately or publikely; kill no man, if ju∣stice do not command it: God requireth you to observe what is above (ordained) perhaps you will consider it. Take not the goods of Orphans, but to succour them, un∣till they be of age, of discretion, measure, and weight, with good weight, and just measure. I enjoyn no man a∣ny thing, but what is in his power to performe. Judge with equity, although it be against your parents and allies; sa∣tisfie what is above (ordained) God commandeth it, per∣adventure you will consider it; it is the right way, which you ought to pursue: go not aside, God commandeth it, perhaps you will fear his divine Majestie. We taught <HI>Mo∣ses</HI> our Commandements; it is a peculiar grace to instruct the righteous, and guide the people in the right way; it may be you will believe in the Resurrection. O ye Inha∣bitants of <HI>Mecca</HI>! We have sent to you the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> full of benediction, perform what is ordained, the impiety, your sins shall be forgiven you; say not, That God hath sent his Law to the two Nations that preceded you; and that it is hid from you. Will you say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Jews and Chri∣stians.</NOTE> That had God taught you the Scripture, you had been more obedient then they? Certainly he hath taught you his Commandements, it is a speciall grace to guide you into the right way: Who is more unjust, then he that blasphemeth against his divine Majesty, and departeth from his Commandements? Such men shall be rigorously chastised in the fire of Hell. Will they expect that the Angels came to visit them? That God should punish, and declare to them his miracles? Will they look for the day of Judgement, wherein repen∣tance and conversion shall be unprofitable? Such as be∣lieve in one part of the Law, and reject the other, have no foundation in their belief. God shall make them to know their errors, and shall punish them after the enor∣mity of their crimes: He that shall do a good work, shall
<PB N="92" REF="57"/>
have a reward tenfold. Whosoever acteth any wickedness, shall be punished in like manner; neither shall he re∣ceive injustice. Say unto them, God hath gvided me in the way of his Law; such as professe the Law of <HI>Abraham,</HI> profess the unity of God; <HI>Abraham</HI> was not in the num∣ber of unbelievers; my prayers, my vows, my life, my death shall be consecrated to God; he hath no compani∣on, I wholly commend my selfe to his divine pleasure. Say unto them, Do I desire to worship other God, then the Lord of the Universe? The good that a man doth, is for himselfe, and the evill that he committeth is against him; you all shall one day appear in the presence of God, he shal resolve your disputes. He it is that prolongeth your posterity, and exalteth some above others, to prove you; your Lord is exact to chactise the wicked, and gracious and mercifull to the righteous.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. The Chapter of Prisons, containing an hundred and six Verses, written at <HI>Mecca.</HI></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Reader, Mahomet <HI>entituled this Chapter, the Chapter of</HI> Aaraf, <HI>which is a place between Paradise and Hell, where men suffer no punishment. See</HI> Mokari, Bedaoi, <HI>and</HI> Kitab el tenoir.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull: I am God, the most wise, the most true. This Book was sent to thee, to preach to the True-beleevers; doubt not the Con∣tents of it. Say unto them, Believe in what was sent to you from your Lord, and worship none other God but him; few there be among you that consider it. How ma∣ny Cities have we destroyed? How often have we infli∣cted our punishment on their Inhabitants by day, and by night, when they reposed? Neverthelesse, they said no∣thing, but that they were greatly afflicted. We will exa∣mine the people to whom we have sent our Prophets, and
<PB N="93" REF="57"/>
require account of what they have learned, and of what they have done. We will examine our Prophets, and de∣mand an account of such as have followed, and obeyed them. I will cause them to remember what they have done worthy of reward. We forsook not our Prophets when they preached to them the Truth; their actions shall be weigh∣ed in the ballance of equity; the ballance of the blessed shall be ponderous with good works; and they whose bal∣lance shall be light of good works, shall be damned, for having contemned our Commandements. We gave you your habitation on the Earth, and there bestowed on you what was necessary for your nourishment; but few of you are gratefull to me. We created and formed you, and com∣manded the Angels to worship <HI>Adam,</HI> which they perfor∣med, except the devill, to whom we said, what hindred thee to worship <HI>Adam,</HI> when we comanded thee? He an∣swered, I am better then he, thou hast created me of fire, and hast created man of the mire of the earth; then said we to him, depart out of Paradise, it is not the habitation of the proud, thou shalt be in the number of them that shall be laden with ignominy; the Devill answered, Let me alone untill the day of the Resurrection of the dead; wherefore hast thou tempted me? I will seduce men from the right way, I will hinder them on the right hand, and on the left, and on all sides, to believe in thy Law, and the greatest part of them shall be ungratefull: we said to him, be gone out of Paradise, thou shalt be abhorred of all the world, and deprived of my mercy; I will fill hell with such as shall follow thee. O <HI>Adam</HI>! dwell with thy wife in Paradise, and there eat of whatsoever shall please thee, but approach not that Tree, lest thou with thy wife be in the number of the unjust. The devill tempted them▪ and dispoyled their bodies of their vestments of grace; he said to them, God hath forbidden you to eat of the fruit of that Tree, that you may not be Angels, or eternall; he swore that he spake the truth, and filled them with ig∣nominy, because of their pride. They knew their naked∣nesse, having eaten of that fruit, and to cover themselves, took leaves of Paradise; their Lord called them, and said,
<PB N="94" REF="58"/>
Did I not forbid you to approach that Tree? I told both of you, that the devill was your open enemy; they said, Lord, we have offended thee, and injured our souls, if thou dost not compassionate us, we shall be in the num∣ber of the damned: he said, Depart out of Paradise, ye enemies of each other, you shall inhabit the earth, untill the time appointed; you shall there live and die, and go from the earth to the day of Judgement. O ye children of <HI>Adam</HI>! we bestowed on you vestment of graces, signes of our Omnipotency, peradventure you wil bear it in minde. O ye children of <HI>Adam</HI>! beware lest the devill seduce you, as he did your Father and Mother, when he caused their departure out of Paradise; he dispoyled them of their garments, and made them know their deformity; he shall appear to you, with such as follow them, and you shall see him, when you least think thereon; he protecteth the Infidels: when they commit any fault, they say, we follow the Law of our Fathers, God hath so commanded us. Say unto them, Doth God command you to offend him? Will you speak of God what you know not? he hath appointed you to doe Justice, to worship him, and embrace his Law. Many shall rise again, as you have seen them; some shall be in the right way, others shall be damned, because they have obeyed the devill, and believed they were in the right way. O children of <HI>Adam,</HI> cloath your selves decently, when you shall repaire to the Temples; eat and drink what pleaseth you; be not prodigall, God abhorreth them that spend their wealth unprofitably: Say unto them, who made the prohibition of decent cloathing, when men go to the Temple to worship God? Who hath forbidden to eat of the goods that God hath given you? This is law∣full for true believers. God shall so expound his Com∣mandements at the day of Judgement. Say unto them, God hath forbidden you whoredome, private and pub∣like, disobedience, injustice, desire to adore any other god but him, and to speake of his divine Majesty what you know not: every one hath his predestination, and none can advance or retard it. O ye children of <HI>Adam,</HI> did not the Prophets teach you my Commandements?
<PB N="95" REF="58"/>
Such as shall fear me, and do good works, shall be delive∣red from affliction <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the day of Judgement; and they that disobey my Commandements, that arise against the Faith, shall dwell eternally in hell fire. Who is more un∣just, then he that blasphemeth against God and his Com∣mandements? Such shall be punished conformably to the Scripture. When the Angels of death shall cause them to die, they shall say, Where be the Idols that you adored in¦stead of God? they shall answer, that those false gods have forsaken them, and shall acknowledge their Idolatry; but God shall say to them, enter into hell with the men and devils that are condemned; they shall execrate the Sec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s that preceded them; and being assembled, they shall say, Lord, judge them, they seduced us, augment their mise∣ries in hell. God shall say, We will adde to their, and your pains, but you understand it not. They shall say a∣mong themselves, we are not the cause that you were un∣believers, you were not such to please us, suffer with us the torments that you have merited. I will not open the gate of heaven to such as disobey my Commandements, untill a Camell pass through the eye of a needle, so will I chastise sinners, hell shall be their bed, fire shall be their covering; and such as shall have done good works; accor∣ding to their power, shall dwell eternally in Paradise. I will remove deceit far from their heart, rivers shall flow in their fields with delights; and they shall say, praysed be God, who hath brought us hither, otherwise we had bin in the number of the erronious: Certainly the Prophets, Gods Messengers, taught us the truth, in saying, the observance of the Commandements of his divine Majesty should ren∣der us heirs of Paradise. Such as shall be saved, shall tell the damned, that they have found the grace foretold them of God, and we will demand of them, if they have not met with the punishment that his divine Majesty did denounce against them; they shall say aloud, Yes, and that the curse of God is upon the unjust, that misled men from his Law, and they shall be eternally in the number of the mi∣serable. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The <HI>Ma∣hometan</HI> Doctors be∣lieve, that such as shall have do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e as much good as evil, and whose bal∣lance shall not decline, neither on the scale of good works or of bad, shall dwell in the place called <HI>Aa∣raf,</HI> with them that have done neither good nor e∣vill; and this place is between Hell and Paradise.</NOTE> Between the blessed and the damned, there is a separation, and a place called <HI>Aaraf,</HI> or prisons, wherin are
<PB N="96" REF="59"/>
many persons, who know the blessed and the damned by their countenances, they call to the blessed and salute them, yet they go not into Paradise, notwithstanding their great desire to enter. When they turn their eyes towards the damned; Lord, (say they) involve us not in the num∣ber of the unjust. Such as are in that place, call to the damned, they know them by their visages, and say, to what served your riches? and that ye arose against the Faith, and Commandements of God? Behold the faithfull (whom ye contemned) you swore they should be deprived of mercy; God hath spoken to them, and hath said, en∣ter into Paradise, and fear not, you shall for ever be ex∣empt from affliction; the damned shall cry unto the bles∣sed, Give us of the water which you drink, and the meats that you eat; they shall answer, The drink and bread of Paradise is prohibited to Infidels, who sported with their faith, that were proud of the wealth of the earth, and that scoffed at the Commandements of God; he hath forgot∣ten them, because they forgot the comming of the day of Judgement, and blasphemed against his precepts. We are come to the Inhabitants of <HI>Mecca</HI> to instruct them in the <HI>Alcoran</HI>; we teach it unto men, to give them knowledge of the right way, and to acquire the mercy of God, if they be∣lieve in that Book: Shall they expect to believe untill they know its explication? Its explication shall appear at the day of Judgement; that day, such as shall have lived with∣out faith, shall say, Certainly the Prophets delivered the Truth; shall we partake of their prayers, will they inter∣cede for us, untill we return to the world to do better then we have done, and to obey Gods Commandements? But they shall be damned, because of their blasphemies. God is your Lord, he created the heaven; and the earth in six dayes, and sitteth on his Throne; he causeth the night in∣continently to succeed the day; the Sun, the Moone, and the Stars, move at his command, and all the world obeyeth him; praised be God, Lord of the Universe: pray to God privately and publikely, he abhorreth the unjust; pollute not the earth, after the ordure is removed; pray to God to avoid his chastisements, and obtain his mercy, which is
<PB N="97" REF="59"/>
for the righteous. It is God that sendeth the windes to dissipate the rain, when they carry the clouds; we drive them charged with water, into places drie, dead, and rui∣ned, and cause the rain to fall there, that they may pro∣duce herbs and fruits; so will we cause the dead to arise a∣gain; perhaps men will remember the good land bringeth forth good fruits, through the permission of its Lord, and the bad land produceth only darneill. I teach my Com∣mandements to such as are not ingratefull: Certainly we sent <HI>Noah</HI> to instruct men; he said, O ye people, worship one God alone; if you adore other then him, you shall be punished at the day of Judgement; their Rulers answered, O <HI>Noah</HI>! thou art in a great error; He replyed, I erre not, I am a messenger sent from God to preach his Will; I give you most wholsome advise, God hath taught me what you know not. Is it strange to you, that he hath sent you his Commandement by the tongue of a man like your selves, to declare to you the torments of Hell? Fear God, he will pardon your sinnes; But they belyed <HI>Noah,</HI> we sa∣ved him in the Arke, with his retinue, and drowned those that contemned our Law, they were altogether blinde. We sent <HI>Hod</HI> to his brother <HI>Aad,</HI> and to his retinue, he said, Oh ye people? worship one God alone, whom will ye adore, or whom feare, but God? The Teachers an∣swered, thou art in an extream ignorance; we believe thee to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the number of lyars; he replyed, I am not a lyar, I am a messenger sent from God, to preach his Com∣mandements, I give good and salutary advice, wonder not that God teacheth you his precepts by the tongue of a man, like you, who declareth to you his pleasure. Re∣member that he left you on Earth after <HI>Noah,</HI> that he encreased you in number, force, and power; Call to minde his grace, you shall be happy. They answered, are we come to this, to worship one God alone, and to relinquish what our fathers adored? Shew us the truth, whereof thou dost preach, if thou art true; he said, the wrath and indignation of God shall fall upon you; will you dispute with us of the names, that you and your fathers imposed on your Idols?
<PB N="98" REF="60"/>
God did not enjoyne to worship them, neither have you reason to doe it; expect your punishment, I will expect it with perseverance. Then did we deliver him from their malice, and all the true believers that were with him, and destroyed those Infidels, by reason of their impiety. Wee sent <HI>Salhe</HI> to <HI>Temod,</HI> and his people; he said to them, Oh ye people! worship but one God, he shall shew you a mi∣racle in this <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Turks believe that <HI>Salhe,</HI> through Gods per∣mission me∣tamorpho∣sed a rock into a Ca∣mel.</NOTE> Camel, suffer it to feed on the Earth, and do to it no harm, left you be chastised: Remember, how God left you on the Earth after <HI>Aad,</HI> he gave you to dwell in the vallies, in the plaines, and mountaines; Re∣member God, and pollute not the Earth any more. Their Captains who were proud, demanded of the poore, if they believed that <HI>Salhe</HI> was indeed the Messenger of God? they answered, We believe in his words, and in his do∣ctrine; Then said those proud men, We abjure what ye believe, we condemne him, and they slew the Camel of <HI>Salhe</HI> in derision, disobeyed the Commandements of God, and said, Oh <HI>Salhe!</HI> Let us now see the punishment that thou didst preach, if thou art of the Prophets; at the same time, an Earthquake, with thunder surprized them, and they remained dead as carkasses in their houses. <HI>Salhe</HI> for∣sook them, and said, Oh ye people! I declared to you the will of God with fidelity, but ye detest them that affect you, and give you good counsels. Remember thou how <HI>Lot</HI> spake to the people, saying, Will you daily defile your selves with whoredome? and with a filthinesse that was never yet seen in the world by any your Predecessours? Will you love men better then women? will you love sin rather then piety? They said, Let us expell <HI>Lot</HI> and his family from our Citie, for that they will not contaminate themselves with us, but God delivered him out of their hands, and those of his house▪ except his wife, who con∣tinued with them that were punished: We caused a raine to fall upon them, that destroyed all of them. Consider the end of the wicked: We sent <HI>Chaib</HI> to the Country of <HI>Madian,</HI> hee said, Oh ye people, worship one God alone, weigh with good weights, measure with good measure, and retaine nothing from your Neighbour:
<PB N="99" REF="60"/>
Possesse not the high wayes, to give terrour to the peo∣ple, Neither divert True-believers from the Law of God: Remember, that you were but a small handfull of men, and he caused you to multiply; consider the end of the wicked; If any among you embrace the faith, and others contemne it, have patience, untill God judge your differences, there is no better judge then he; Their Teachers said; Oh <HI>Chaib,</HI> wee will banish thee from <HI>Madian,</HI> thee and those that are of thy faith, if thou art of our Religion; he answered, should I not abhorre your Religion, I should blaspheme against God, who hath delivered me, I will follow it, if it please God, hee knoweth all things, I recommend my selfe wholly to the will of his divine Majesty; Lord judge our controver∣sie, thou art the best Judge of the world. Then said their Teachers to the people, if you follow <HI>Chaib,</HI> you are damned; not long after an Earth-quake, and Thun∣der surprized them, and in the morning they were found dead in their houses; such as belyed <HI>Chaib,</HI> found no safe∣ty in their habitations, they were wretched, hee aban∣doned them, and said, Oh ye people! I have preached to you the will of God with fidelity; I will no lon∣ger afflict my selfe with the malice of the wicked. Wee infflicted sicknesse and poverty on them that disobey∣ed the Prophets, whom we sent to the Inhabitants of <HI>Madian</HI>; peradventure they will be converted. Wee proved them through diseases and health, and gratified them in many occurrences, yet they said, our fathers were afflicted with sicknesse and povertie, we shall be as they, but we chastised them for their sinne, when they least considered it. Had the Inhabitants of <HI>Mecca</HI> had our feare before their eyes, and obeyed our Com∣mandements, we had opened to them the blessing of Heaven and Earth; wee will punish them, because they are impious: Some there be, that shall be afflicted in the night, when they sleep; and others that shall be tormen∣ted by day, when they sport, and recreate themselves; they believed God to be a deceiver, and are damned. God guideth into the right way True-believers, and makes

them Heire of the Earth, after their parents; had he so pleased, he might have destroyed all the world, he might have hardened the hearts of the people, and no man had harkned to his word. I recount what things befell that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">To <HI>Mec∣ca.</HI></NOTE> City, many Prophets have been sent to its Inhabitants, and wrought many miracles, yet would they not relinqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h their former impietie; thus have we hardned the hearts of Infidels; they violated their promises, and wee found most of them to be wicked and disobedient. We sent <HI>Moses</HI> to <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> and his people, he to them shew∣ed miracles, which through their malice they contem∣ned, but consider the end of those wicked men; <HI>Moses</HI> said unto <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> I am a messenger sent from God, the God of the Universe; when I speak of God, I deliver the Truth; I am come, through his command, to tell thee, thou must dismisse with me the Children of Israel, and no longer detaine them in thy dominions. <HI>Pharaoh</HI> said, if thou commest from God, and art true in thy say∣ings, let us see some miracles; then he cast upon the ground his staffe, which was changed into a Serpent, shewed his hand, that appeared exceeding white to the eyes of the Spectators. The Doctors of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> said, this man is a Magician, he would have us to abandon our Country, what is your opinion? detain him prisoner, and his brother, and send into your Cities, to assemble Magi∣cians. The Magicians of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> appearing before him, they said,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gelaldin</HI> saith <HI>Mo∣ses</HI> his hand was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owne.</NOTE> what shall be our reward, if we shall be victori∣ous? He replyed to them, you shall be well rewarded, and shall be of them that approach my person. They said, oh <HI>Moses</HI>! wilt thou first cast down thy staffe on the ground, or shall we ours? <HI>Moses</HI> bad them cast down theirs, which they did, enchanting the eyes of the spectators, and terri∣fying them with an extraordinary enchantment; God in∣spired <HI>Moses</HI> to cast down his Rod, which devoured the staves of the other, and the Truth appeared above fals∣hood, and above the vanity of their actions; they were van∣quished, to their confusion, forsook their magick, and pro∣strating themselves on the earth, uttered these words; We believe in the Lord of the Universe, the Lord of <HI>Moses,</HI>
<PB N="101" REF="61"/>
and of <HI>Aaron; Pharaoh</HI> said to them, Ye believe in the God of <HI>Moses</HI> without my permission; this is a deceit, invented by you, to drive the people out of my Do∣minions; but you shall soon know the punishment that I will lay upon you, I will cut off your feete and hands, and command you to be crucified. They answered, We recommend our selves wholly to the will of God, whatsoever is thy revenge on us, thou shalt not hin∣der us to believe in the miracles that wee see, nei∣ther to obey the Commandements of his divine Ma∣jesty; Lord give us patience, and to dye in the num∣ber of True-believers. Then said <HI>Pharaoh's</HI> Doctors, dismisse <HI>Moses,</HI> and his people, that they may goe whi∣ther they see good, to pollute the Earth, that they may leave thee in quiet with thy Gods; He said, I will cause their Childeren to be slain, their wives to be abu∣sed, and I will inflict upon them a thousand torments. <HI>Moses</HI> said to his people; Implore succors of God with patience, and prayers, the whole Earth is Gods, he gi∣veth it to inherit, to whom he seeth good: the other world is for the righteous. They said, Oh <HI>Moses</HI>! We, before, thy coming, desired the death of our enemies; he reply∣ed, God will not destroy your enemies, to leave you a∣lone upon the Earth, he shall behold your actions. We afflicted <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his Subjects with famine, perhaps unbelievers will consider it. When any happinesse befell them, they said, they well deserved it, and when they fell into misery, they affirmed <HI>Moses</HI> and his people to be the cause of it; It is God that punished them, but of this most of them were ignorant. They said unto <HI>Moses,</HI> cease to shew us thy miracles to inchant us, we will not obey thee: We sent upon them a Deluge, Grasse-hoppers, Lice, Frogs, and Bloud, one after another; neverthelesse they were proud, and in the number of the wicked. When our wrath fell upon them, they said, oh <HI>Moses</HI>! call upon thy Lord, that hee give us what to thee he promised, remove his displeasure from us, we will believe thee, and will dismisse with thee, the Children of Israel: When we delivered them from affliction, they sharpened their
<PB N="102" REF="62"/>
tongues, murmured, and violated their promises; we a∣venged our selves upon them, and drowned them in the Sea, for that they contemned our miracles, and we gave the West and East to the Children of Israel, who were humble before us; we gave them our blessing, our word was accomplished upon them, because of their perseve∣rance, and we destroyed the Armies of <HI>Pharoah.</HI> The Children of Israel having past the Sea, met with men that adored Idols, and said, oh <HI>Moses</HI>! make unto us Gods, like to the Gods of this people; he answered, ye are ig∣norant; these men are wretched, what they doe is but ig∣norance and vanity; shall I desire that you worship other Gods, then God that preferred you to all the world? We have delivered you from <HI>Pharoah's</HI> people, who caused you to endure great torments, they murther'd your children, a∣bused your wives, and you suffered heavy afflictions for the punishment of your sins. We detained <HI>Moses</HI> on the Mountaine thirty nights, and ten other nights, which is in all forty nights; when he went up, he said to his bro∣ther <HI>Aaron,</HI> be thou my Lieutenant, command this peo∣ple in mine absence, and follow not the path of the wic∣ked. When <HI>Moses</HI> at the time appointed arrived at the top of the Mountaine, and that his Lord spake to him, he said, Lord permit me to see thee, he said, thou shalt not see me; behold this Mountaine, if it continue firme in this place, thou shalt be able to see me; when the Lord appeared upon the Mountaine with his light, it was re∣duced to ashes, and <HI>Moses</HI> amazed, fell on the ground, as dead. When he rose againe, he said blessed be the name of God, I desire to obey him, and believe that no man li∣ving is able to behold him. He said to <HI>Moses,</HI> I have cho∣sen and preferred thee to all the world, I have made thee a Prophet, thou hast talked with me, receive the grace which I have bestowed on thee, and be not ingratefull. We gave to him the Tables, whereon was written what was necessary for the salvation of men, and we said to him, receive with affection, what I give thee, and command thy people to observe the contents of those Tables. I will precipitate into Hell such as transgresse my Commande∣ments;
<PB N="103" REF="62"/>
I will deprive the proud of my graces, they will not believe in my Law, although they see all the miracles in the world; if they see the right way, they will not fol∣low it; they see the way of error, and pursue it; because they have abjured my Commandements, and rejected my grace, the good works of them that disobey me, and that believe not in the Resurrection, are unprofitable, they shall be chastised after their demerits. The people of <HI>Moses,</HI> after his departure, adored the Calfe, a bellow∣ing God, saw they not, that it spake not to them? nei∣ther could conduct them into the right way? Neverthe∣lesse they adored it, for which they were greatly too blame. When this Calfe fell to the ground, and they found their errour, they said, if God have not pity on us, we shall be miserable. When <HI>Moses</HI> returned, he said to them, whom did ye obey after my departure? You were too ha∣sty to worship that Idol; he in displeasure cast against the ground the Tables that God had given him, took his brother by the head, and dragging him to him, said Son of my mother, how hast thou governed this people? I wanted power, replyed he, and could not divert them from their evill; It wanted little but they had slain me, do me no harme; rejoyce not my enemies with my misery, and account me not with those that adored Idols: <HI>Moses</HI> said, Lord pardon me, and my brother, give us thy mercy; thou art the mercifull of the mercifull. The wrath of God, and the infamy of the world shall fall upon them that worshiped the Calf, and blasphemed against God; he will be pitifull to such as shall repent, and believe in his divine Majesty. The displeasure of <HI>Moses</HI> being allay∣ed, he againe tooke the Tables, whereon was written the way of salvation, for such as have the feare of their Lord before their eyes; he caused to be separated from his peo∣ple, at a time appointed, threescore and ten persons, who were surprized with an earth-quake, and with thunder; and said, Lord, thou couldst have destroyed them, before they adored the Calf; wilt thou destroy us all, because of the sin of the ignorant that are amongst us? Thou hast de∣sired to prove this people; thou guidest, and causest to
<PB N="104" REF="63"/>
erre whom thou pleasest; thou art our Protector, pardon our sins; for thou art altogether mercifull; give us thy grace in this world, and guide us to the day of Judge∣ment, neer to thy divine Majestie: He said, I will punish as I see good, my mercy embraceth the whole world; it is for such as have my feare before their eyes, that pay Tithes, obey my Commandements, follow the right way, believe in the Prophet, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This is <HI>Mahomet.</HI></NOTE> who can neither write nor read, and what is written in the Old Testament, and the Gospell;<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Kitab el tenoir.</HI></NOTE> he shall command them things honest; he shall prohibit things uncivill; he shall teach them what meats are clean, and forbid them to eat what is unclean; he shall deliver them from Ceremonies, weighty and truble∣some, and from the chains that strictly bind them: Such as shall believe in him, that shall honour him, that shall defend him from his enemies, and follow the light that we shall send him, shall be happy. Say unto the people, I am indeed a messenger sent from God, to whom appertaineth the kingdome of the Heavens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turks believe that <HI>Mahomet</HI> could nei∣ther write nor read.</NOTE> and of Earth; there is but one God alone, he giveth life and death, as seemeth good to him. Believe in God, and in his Prophet, who can neither read nor write. Such as shall believe in God, in his Word, and follow the Prophet, shall not erre; they shall follow a very good way. There are some of the chil∣dren of <HI>Israel</HI> that knew the truth, and judge with equity. We divided them into twelve Tribes, when <HI>Moses</HI> requi∣red drink for his people, we inspired him to strike the rock with his rod, whence flowed twelve fountains, and every one knew the place where he should drink; we co∣vered them with the shaddow of clouds; we caused <HI>Man∣na</HI> and <HI>Quailes</HI> to descend upon them, and commanded them to eat of the good things which we gave them. They did not hurt us (when they murmured) but affli∣cted themselves.<NOTE PLACE="marg">This is the holy land.</NOTE> It was said to them, Dwell in this City, and eat therein what shall please you; enter at the gate with adoration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Gelal∣din.</HI></NOTE> and beg pardon of your sinnes. I will pardon you, and will augment the graces of the righte∣ous; nevertheless the wicked that were among them, altered the words that were spoken to them, and per∣verted
<PB N="105" REF="63"/>
them; and we sent upon them our indignation from Heaven, because of their impiety. Ask of them concern∣ing a village that was upon the shore of the Sea, whose in∣habitants observed not the Sabbath, and fished on the day of rest; they saw in that day, Serpents appear upon the water, and other dayes they saw none. Thus are tryed them, because of their disobedience: A party of them said, Fish not, O people, it is lost labor; God shall destroy and chastise them with grievous torments, then their Doctors said, They shall implore pardon of the Lord, perhaps they will fear to offend him another time. When they rejected what we taught them; we saved such among them as ab∣stain from evil-doing, and grievously afflicted the wicked, because of their disobedience; when they gloried in their sin, we said to them, Be ye contemned, and abhorred, as Apes; thy Lord shall send to them at the day of Judge∣ment, persons to torment them; he is exact in punishing the wicked, and mercifull to the righteous. We sent upon them good and evill, to prove them, peradventure they will be converted. Their posterity left a progeny, heirs of their doctrine; nevertheless, they returned to their sins, and say, the Lord shall pardon them; they beg pardon of him; and return daily to their sin:<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Gelal∣din.</HI></NOTE> Shall not account be required from them, of what is ordained in the Scripture? To wit, not to speak of God, but with truth: They have read the Truth, but have not comprehended it. Pa∣radise is onely for the righteous; I will not deprive them of recompense, who make their prayers at the time ap∣pointed, and observe what is contained in the Scriptures. Remember thou, how we raised a mountain over them, to shelter them, and how they believed it would fall upon their heads; wee said to them, Learne with affection what we teach you, and remember; per∣haps you will feare disobedience. Thy Lord caused to come out of <HI>Adams</HI> reins, all his posteritie; and asked them, saying, Am not I your Lord? they answered, yes, thou art our Lord, we know it well: They cannot there∣fore say at the day of Judgement, That they knew not his unitie; they shall say for excuse, Our fathers adored
<PB N="106" REF="64"/>
many gods before us, we are their posterity; wilt thou destroy us, because of their iniquity? Thus doe I discover my mysteries to men; it may be they will be converted. Relate to them the history of him that saw our miracles; he was dispoiled of his understanding, the Devill follow∣ed it, and he was in the number of the wretched. Had we so pleased, we had exalted him through the knowledge of our wonders, among the Doctors; but he crouched to the ground, and followed his owne appetite, like to a chafed dog; if thou chase him with choller, he putteth forth his tongue; if thou leave him at rest, he will still put forth his tongue, like to the Infidels, that contemn our instructions; if thou recount to them our miracles, or do not recount, perhaps they will be converted, perhaps they will not be converted, and shall be like such as have abjured our Commandements, and injured their own souls. He whom God guideth, is well guided; and he whom God mis-leadeth, is in the number of the misera∣ble. We have created Hell to punish▪ Devils and men; they have hearts, and comprehend no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the truth; they have eyes, and see it not; ears have they, and heare it not; they are like to beasts, and worse then beasts; they are altogether ignorant. The most beautifull names of the world appertaine to God: Beseech him by the beau∣ty of his name, and depart from them that depart from the truth, through the names that they impose on their Idols; they shall be chastised after their demerits. Some there be that follow the truth, and judge with equity, I will by degrees punish them that shall reject our Com∣mandements, when they shall think thereon. I will defer their punishment some time, because my wrath is vio∣lent: Remember they not, that they said, <HI>Mahomet</HI> is possest of the Devill? On the contrary, he declareth the joyes of Paradise, and preacheth the torments of Hell. Consider they not the Kingdome of Heaven and of Earth, which God hath created of nothing? The fear of death shall arrive before they have acknowledged their sins; in what will they believe, if they have not faith in the <HI>Al∣coran?</HI> He whom God shall mis-lead, shall find none to
<PB N="107" REF="64"/>
guide him; he shall leave Infidels confounded in their disobedience. They shall enquire of thee concerning the hour and day of Judgement. Say unto them, No man knoweth it but God; but the greatest part of the world believe it not. I have not power to do either good or e∣vill of my self, if God do not permit it; If I knew the future, I should provide wealth to preserve me from po∣verty: I am sent only to declare the joyes of Paradise, and preach the torments of Hell to them that believe in God; he it is that created you of one sole person, and created his spouse of his rib, to dwell with her: When she doubted of being with child, she ceased not to travell as she was wont; but when her conception rendred her heavy, they both besought God, their Lord, and said, Lord give an happy progeny, to the end we may be in the number of them that return thee thanks for thy fa∣vours. When God gave them a son, a r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghteous man, they associated him in what he had given them; and all of them exalted the glory of his divine Majesty, above the Idols of the Infidels, that adored things which could cre∣ate nothing, that are things created, and can do neither good nor harme. If you call Idolaters to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> right way, they will not follow you; if ye invoke Idols, misery shall be upon you; will you be mute, to professe the unity of God? will you worship the Creatures, instead of the Crea∣tors Go, adore your Idols, and may they heare your pray∣ers, if you believe them to be Gods: Have they feet to walk, hands to touch, eys to see, and eares to heare? Say unto them, if ye invoke your Idols, and conspire against me, you shall find none to protect you, God is my pro∣tector, he hath caused the <HI>Alcoran</HI> to descend from Hea∣ven, he is the defendor of the righteous, what ye adore, can neither benefit nor hurt you; If thou invokest Idols, they shall not heare thee, they shall look upon thee, and shall not see thee; do what is lawfull to be done, com∣mand things honest, and depart from the ignorant; if the Devill would seduce thee, trust in God, he heareth and knoweth all things; such as fear him remember his mer∣cies and chastisements when they are tempted of the Devil.
<PB N="108" REF="65"/>
Although Infidels know the Truth, the Devill ceaseth not to continue them in their sin, they alwayes follow their im∣piety; If thou goest to them to instruct them, they say, thou singest an old song, say unto them, I doe what my Lord inspired into me, what I teach you, is the light of faith, the right way, and the grace of God for them that believe in his divine Majesty; for such as heare the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and study it, perhaps God will give you his mercy.

other thing then the glory and honour of victory? God confirmeth the Truth by his words, and destroyeth the wicked, he ratifieth the Truth, and destroyeth falshood, although it be contrary to the will of the impious. Re∣member, that your Lord heard you, when you of him im∣plored succors, and that he assisted you with a thousand of his Angels sent from Heaven; God sent you this aide, only to let you know his grace, and to confirme your hearts; victory proceedeth from God, he is omnipotent, and most prudent: Remember that God covered you with a secure sleep, and caused water to descend from Heaven, to wash, purifie, and deliver you from the ma∣lice of the Devill. Plant in your heart generosity, and patience, and goe on with assurance. God hath said to his Angels, I will be with you, confirme the steps of the True-believers; I will cast feare into the heart of the wicked, strike them on the head, smite them on the fingers, and feet, because they have contradicted my will, and that of the Prophet. God severely chastiseth such as dis∣obey his Commandements, and oppose the will of his Pro∣phet; the unbelievers have heretofore tasted of his pu∣nishments in this world, and shall in the end feele the paines of the fire of Hell. Oh yee who believe in God! turne not the back to the wicked, as vanquished, when they approach to fight you, he that shall turne the back, shall returne in the wrath of God, and be throwne head∣long into the fire of Hell.

The ignominy and mi∣sery that God layeth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n beasts, is to be deaf and dumb, and to want the use of reason: Had God seen any good inclination in the Infidels, he had not left them in their de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nesse; but although they had heard clearly, they should have alwayes departed from his Law, and have been obstinate.

Their prayers are very light, they goe hand in hand in the Temple, but shall one day feel the punishment of God, because of their impiety. The unbelievers that expend their wealth, to turne the people from the Law of God, shall have sorrow for their expence, they shall be infamous, and precipitated into the fire of Hell. God shall separate the good from the wicked, he shall cast the wicked head-long into Hell fire, and they shall be in the number of the damned: if they repent, he will remit what is past, and if they returne to fight against the Prophet, they shall be entreated as the first: kill them, to avoyd sedition, that there may be no law in the world, but the Law of God; If they forsake their impiety, God shall behold their actions, if they depart from the faith, know that God alone is your Lord, and protector.

Oh ye that believe! make an Halt, when you are in view of your enemies Troops, and pray to God with affection, perhaps you shall be happy, obey God, and the Prophet, his Apostle; if disorder and terror surprise you, you shall loose your reputation, persevere, God is with them that continue to doe well. Be not like them that went out of their houses with dissembled joy, and hypo∣crisie, and turne the people from the right way, God knoweth all their actions; The Devill caused them to find pleasure in their doings, saying to them, none shall this day obtaine victory over you, I will be with you; and when they beheld the two Camps in battailia, hee returned on his steps, fled, and said, I am innocent of the evill that you commit, I <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Turks be∣lieve, that the Devill saw the Angels fight for <HI>Mahomet.</HI></NOTE> see what you see not, I fear the omnipotent God, he is severe in his punishments. The wicked, and such as were weak in their faith, spea∣king of the True believers, said, These men glory in their Law: It was replyed to them, he that relyeth on God, shall find him to be more powerfull then his ene∣mies, and that he is most prudent in whatsoever he doth. Thou sawest the Angels that slew the Infidels, they did beat them behind and before, and said to them, taste the torments of the fire which you have merited, God is not unjust to his Creatures. The people of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> were In∣fidels, and those that preceded them, contemned the mi∣racles and Commandements of God, but he rigorously chastised them, he is omnipotent, and most severe in his punishments, he shall destroy them that alter the graces he hath given to the people, untill they have altered the grace he hath conferred on themselves. <HI>Pharaohs</HI> people were Infidels, their Predecessors disobeyed the Comman∣dements of thy Lord;<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Kitab el tenoir.</HI></NOTE> but we destroyed them because of their sinne, we drowned them for that they were unjust; The wicked are like to beasts, they shall never be∣lieve in God.

pursueth them, peradventure they will consider it. If you feare that any one will betray you, and be wanting to their word, receive no promise from him, neither pro∣mise him any thing, God abhorreth Traytors: Believe not that Infidels escape the punishment of God, returne with your whole strength to fight against them; the hal∣ters of your horses shall terrifie the enemies of God, and of you, and of other persons who ye know not, but God knoweth them all. Your expence for his service, shall be payed you, and no injustice shall be done to you; If thine enemies incline to peace, thou shalt doe ill to in∣cline, as they, trust in God, he understandeth what they say, and knoweth whatsoever they doe; if they desire to betray thee, God shall protect thee; and all True-be∣lievers endeavour to unite their hearts; but although thou shouldst expend all the riches of the world, thou shalt not be able to unite them, God shall one day unite them, he is omnipotent, and prudent in all his workes. O Prophet! the protection of God sufficeth thee, and the righteous that follow thee. Exhort the True-belie∣vers to fight against Infidels; if ye be twenty assembled with resolution and perseverance, ye shall vanquish two hundred Infidels; if ye be an hundred, ye shall overthrow a thousand, the unbelievers are ignorant; but God will lighten your burden he knoweth your weaknesse; if ye be an hundred true believers, ye shall defeat two hundred Infidels; if ye be a thousand, you shall subdue two thou∣sand by the permission of God, he aideth such as expect his succors with perseverance. The Prophet cannot be a prisoner, he shall establish himselfe on earth with ad∣vantage, over unbelievers; Ye desire the wealth of the earth, and God will give you the treasures of Heaven, he is omnipotent and wise. If God had not taught you his Commandements, yee should have suffered great tor∣ments; eat of clean beasts that he hath permitted you to eate, and feare God, he is gracious and mercifull to them that have his feare before their eyes. Oh Prophet! say to them, that shall be prisoners in thy hands, God knoweth what is in your hearts, he shall reward you for
<PB N="114" REF="68"/>
what ye shall have lost, and shall pardon your sinnes; If you be converted, he is gracious and mercifull. If they betray thee, they betrayed God before thee, separate them from the True-believers, God knoweth all things, and is most prudent in what he ordaineth. Such as have be∣lieved in God, as have departed from the wicked, as have employed their wealth, and persons to fight for the Law of God, such as have protected the Prophet, and defen∣ded him, are all protectors, and friends to each other; you shall have no consideration of the alliance of the True-believers, that desert not the company of Infidels, untill they be separated from them. If they require of you succors touching Religion, you are obliged to pro∣tect them, except against such as have confederacy with you, God seeth all your actions. The Infidels protect each other, if you obey them, great disorders shall en∣sue, and many seditions in the earth. Such as have be∣lieved in God, as have deserted the wicked, as have fought for the Law of God, as have established the Pro∣phet, and defended him against his enemies, are indeed faithfull and True-believers, they shall receive from God pardon of their sinnes, and exceeding great treasures. Such as having believed in God, have departed from the wicked, and have fought with you, are yours, they shall be the Heirs of their parents, God hath so appoin∣ted it, he knoweth all things.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. The Chap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er of Conversion, containing an hundred twenty and seven Verses, written at <HI>Medina.</HI></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Reader, <HI>this Chapter beginneth not as the rest, with these words, In the name of God, gracious and mercifull; because these are words of peace and salvation, and for that in this Chap∣ter,</HI> Mahomet <HI>co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mandeth to breake Truce with his enemies, and to assault them. Many Mahometan Doctors have entituled this the Chapter of punishment, or paine. See the Exposition of</HI> Gelaldin, <HI>and that of</HI> Bedaoi, <HI>and</HI> el tenoir.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>A Letter Parent from God, and his Prophet, to the un∣believers with whom ye have made truce. Travell in safety the space of foure months, know, ye shall not ren∣der God impotent, and that he will lay shame upon your forehead. Advice for the people, at the day of great Pil∣grimage, from God, and his Prophet: God approveth not the action of them that adore Idols, his Prophet is innocent from that sinne; If ye repent, ye shall doe well, if ye abandon the Law of God, know ye shall not escape the punishment of your crime; preach to the unbelievers, that they shall suffer grievous torments, except those with whom ye have made Truce, who fall not fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what they have promised, and that protect none against you. Ob∣serve exactly untill the prefixed time, what you have pro∣mised them, God loveth them that feare him: When the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th of <HI>He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am</HI> shall be past, kill them where you shall meet them, take them slaves, detain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them prisoners, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> observe where they passe to lay ambush for them; if they be converted, if they pray at the time appointed, and pay tithes, leave them in quiet, God is mercifull to them th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt. If the Infidels demand quarter of you, give them quarter, to the end they may learne the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of God; teach them his Commandements, for they are ignorant. How should they have Truce with God and his Prophet? If they believe n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ither in the one, nor the other, except
<PB N="116" REF="69"/>
them with whom you entred Truce in the Temple of <HI>Mec∣ca</HI>? If they observe their promise to you, observe what ye promised to them, God loveth such as have his feare be∣fore their eyes▪ How shall they have truce with you? If they have advantage over you, they will respect nei∣ther your alliance nor confederacy; They will speak well of you, and contemne you in their heart, the grea∣test part of them are impious, they have preferred the ri∣ches of this world to the Commandements of God, and have hindered the people to follow his Law, as if they knew not what they did; they beare no respect to the True-believers, wherein they are exceedingly too blame. If they turne, and make their prayers at the time ap∣pointed, if they pay Tithes, they shall be your brethren in God. I teach the mysteries of faith to such as have un∣derstanding to comprehend them, if they break their promise and disturb them of your Religion, kill their Captains, as persons without faith, they will perhaps put an end to their impiety. Slay such especially that re∣nounce their faith, who have endeavoured to drive the Prophet from <HI>Mecca,</HI> and have begun to slay you, will you feare them! will ye be terrified by them? It is reasonable that ye feare God; if ye believe in his Law, fight them, God shall chastise them by your hands, he shall render them dishonourable, and protect you against them, he shall for∣tifie the hearts of True-believers, and expell melancholy, he pardoneth whom he seeth good, knoweth all things, and is most prudent in what he ordaineth. Think ye to be forsaken of God, and that he discerneth not them that have fought gallantly for his Law, from such as have adored Idols, and disobeyed his Prophet? The True-believers abandon not their Religion another time to professe it: God knoweth all your actions, Infidels must not enter into the Temple of <HI>Mecca,</HI> knowing that they are Infidels, the good works which they shall doe in this world shall be unprofitable, and they shall dwell eternally in the fire of Hell. They that believe in God, and the day of Judgement, that make their prayers at the time appoin∣ted, pay Tithes, and worship one God alone, shall vi∣sit
<PB N="117" REF="69"/>
the Temples of his divine Majesty, and such as fear the creatures more then the Creator erre from the right way; We have ordained that such as shall bear fresh water to Pilgrims, and them that shall visit the Temple of <HI>Mecca,</HI> shall be in the number of them that believe in God, and the day of Judgement. Such as fight for the faith are not all equall in graces, and merits before God, he guideth not the unjust. Such as have believed in God, as have de∣parted from the wicked, and employed their wealth and persons to fight for his Law, shall have a particular de∣gree, and a particular place neer to his divine Majesty, they shall be the more happy. Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> through his goodnesse declareth to them, that they shall enter into delicious gar∣dens, where they shall remain eternally, there is with God a very great reward. Oh ye that believe! obey not your fathers, nor your brothers, that love rather to follow impiety, then the faith. Such as shall obey them, shall of∣fend exceedingly; if your father, your children, your brothers, your wives, your parents, your friends, the wealth that you have gained, the fear of losing your ri∣ches, and apprehension of poverty, have more of power over you then God and his Prophet, and hinder you to fight for the faith, the Commandement of God shall be executed against you, he guideth not the wicked, and hath protected you in many occasions. Remember the day of battel of <HI>Hanin,</HI> when ye rejoyced in the multitude of your men, it did not advantage you, fear made you finde the place too narrow for flight, and ye turned the back as vanquished: Remember that God, at that time, put his Prophet, and the True-believers in a place of safe∣ty, and sent invisible Troops to chastise the Infidels, he pardoneth sinnes as seemeth good to him, he is gra∣cious and mercifull. Oh ye that believe in God! Un∣believers are unclean, permit not that they enter into the Temple of <HI>Mecca</HI> after this year, if ye have appre∣hension of want, God shall enrich you with his grace, if it please him, he is omniscient and most prudent. Fight a∣gainst them that believe not in God, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the day of Judge∣ment, that forbid not to act what God hath prohibited,
<PB N="118" REF="70"/>
and his Prophet hath forbidden, and that judge not ac∣cording to the Law of truth, wherein they were instru∣cted, who heretofore received the written Law: they chuse rather to pay Tribute, then to be converted, there∣fore are they contemptible. The <HI>Jews</HI> have said, that the Son of God is most powerfull; the Christians, that the <HI>Messiah</HI> is the Son of God; their words are like to the words of the Infidels that preceded them, but God shall lay upon them his curse. Consider how they blaspheme; they adore their Doctors, and Priests, and the <HI>Messiah</HI> al∣so, the Son of <HI>Mary</HI>; who commanded them to worship one God alone, there is but on sole God: praised be God, there is nothing equall to him; they would extin∣guish the light of God with their mouth, but he shall not suffer them; he shall cause it appear, notwithstanding it be vexatious to the Infidels. He hath sent his Prophet to conduct men into the right way, to preach the Law of Truth, and to make it eminent above all other Laws of the world, against the will of Idolaters. O ye that truly believe! many of the Doctors and Priests eat unprofita∣bly the substance of the people, and divert them from the Law of God: declare to such as treasure up, and expend nothing in pious works, they shall suffer great torments at the day when the fire of hell shall be kindled upon them, it shall burn their forehead, sides, and back; it shall be said to them, behold the wealth which ye have treasured up for your souls, tast the fruits of your trea∣sures which ye have amass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, When God created the hea∣ven and the earth, hee ordained the year of twelve moneths, amongst which foure are priviledged. O stead not God, especially in those moneths; fight at all times against unbelievers, as they will fight against you, and know that God is with them that have his feare before their eyes. Sloath and forgetfuln<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss abound in impiety; God misleadeth thro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh negligence the unbelievers, that prefer one moneth to another, in imitation of what is command<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d: they permit to do what God hath forbid∣den, and delight in the malice of their actions, but God is not the guide of the wicked. O ye that believe! where∣fore
<PB N="119" REF="70"/>
have ye inclined to the earth? Why did ye prefer the wealth of this world to that of Paradise; when you were commanded to go forth of your houses to fight for the Law of God? The riches of this world are contemptible, if you consider those of heaven; if you leave not your houses to fight with the Prophet, God shall severely pu∣nish you, and put other persons in your places; you shall not protect the Prophet, God alone is his protector; he protected him when he went out of <HI>Mecca</HI>; he, with his Companion, they being both in a cave, he said to his Companion, afflict not thy selfe, God is with us; He hath defended, and succoured us by invisible troops; hee hath debased the word of unbelievers, and exalted that of true believers; he is Omnipotent and wise. Fight accor∣ding to your power for the Law of God, you shall do well if you have knowledge to understand it; if you require the wealth of this world, honour, and reputation, they are not far from you, they follow you at hand, but the punishment of crimes and misery are as yet farre remote of Infidels; they sweare by the Name of God, that they were unable to go out of <HI>Mecca</HI> with the Prophet, in which they destroy their soules, for God knoweth them to be lyars: excuse them not, that thou knowest not them that spoke truth, and those that were lyars. True belie∣vers will not excuse themselves from fighting, or employ∣ing their wealth and persons for the Law of God; hee knoweth such as fear him. They that believe not in God, neither the day of Judgement, refuse to go with thee, they doubt the mysteries of Faith, but shall continue in their doubt, to their confusion; had they inclined to go out a∣gainst the enemy, they had arms to perform it; God con∣temned their going out, rendred them negligent, and caused them to remain with the sick, the women, and chil∣dren; had they gone forth with you, they had brought with them more of disorder then affection to the service of his divine Majestie; they hate you, neverthelesse you hearken to them: God knoweth them that are too blame, they hated thee heretofore, accused thee of all their mis∣chief, untill, through the permission of God, the truth

They swear by the name of God, that they are yours, and are not, and fear to be discovered; if they meet with any Den, Cave, or House, wherein to hide them, they speedi∣ly repaire thither. There be of them that say, it is igno∣minious to give alms; if they give alms, it is with cholor if they gave them for the love of God and his Prophet▪ they would say, God is our benefactor; he will give u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> through his grace, and to the Prophet, whatsoever shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be necessary, our hope is in him.

Prophet shall feel grievous torments; they swear by the Name of God, that they desire to content God, and his Prophet; it is reasonable that they content them, if they be good men; know they not, that such as transgress the Will of God, and that of his Prophet, shall be eternally damned? The wicked fear lest God should discover to the righteous the malice that they conceal in their souls, and that they contemne them; Say unto them, ye shall be con∣temned, for God bringeth to light what you feare. If you question them concerning what they say, they will answer for excuse, that they had no evill intent, and that they but jeast; say unto them, will you jeast with God, with his Commandements, and his Prophets? There is none excuse for you, ye are truly impious; if God par∣don any one of you, he shall rigorously punish such as per∣sist to offend him. The wicked teach among them impiety to their posterity, they depart from the truth; they goe hand in hand, and agree to disobey God; they forget God, and God forgetteth them; he hath prepared hell for them, where they shall remain eternally; he hath cursed them, and they shall feel the torment of infinite pains. The wic∣ked that were before you, shall undergo them like you, they were more powerfull then you, they possessed store of wealth, and had many children, they possessed part of their substance, and ye possesse yours, as did your prede∣cessors; ye were plunged in impiety, as they were plun∣ged, but the good works that they have done in this world, shall be to them unprofitable, and at the day of Judgement, they shall be in the number of the miserable. Have they not known the History of their Predecessors, the History of the people of <HI>Noah,</HI> of <HI>Aad,</HI> of <HI>Temod,</HI> of <HI>A∣braham,</HI> and the cities that were subverted? The Pro∣phets preached to them the Commandements of God, who did to them no injustice; they drew affliction on themselves, through the enormitie of their crimes. The true believers mutually obey each other; they com∣mand to do what things are honest, prohibit to act what is not approved; they make their prayers at the time ap∣pointed, distribute tithes, obey God and his Prophet;
<PB N="122" REF="72"/>
God shall remit to them their sins, he is Omnipotent, and hath promised to them gardens, wherein flow many rivers, and an habitation full of content in <HI>Eden</HI>; he hath promised them his grace, which is the perfection of felici∣tie. O Prophet! fight against the Infidels, fortifie thy self against them, hell shall be their habitation; they shall swear by the Name of God, that they have not traduced thee; nevertheless they have detracted and uttered words full of impietie: they have denied to have been enriched through the grace of God, and of his Prophet; if they turn, they shall do well; if they abandon the Faith, God shall punish them in this world, and in the other, with grievous torments, and on earth they shall find no pro∣tector; there be of them, who have inclined to capitulate with God, and have said, if God doth good to us, we will believe in him; when he did good to them, they were niggards, and avaritious; they have erred, and disobeyed his Commandements, but he chastised them, because of their impiety; he hath imprinted it in their hearts untill the day of Judgement, for that they have disobeyed him, because they violated their promises, and by reason of their lies; know they not that God understandeth what they conceale in their hearts? and that he knoweth what is present, past, and future? There be of them, who deride the true believers, that give almes according to their power; God shall deride them, and they shall feel the rigour of eternall pains; implore pardon for them, or implore it not, when thou shalt beg sixty and ten times pardon for them, God shall not pardon them, be∣cause they are ingratefull towards him, and his Prophet, God doth not guide them that disobey him; they rejoy∣ced to be left behinde the Prophet, when he went to fight for the Service of God, they had an aversion to fight, and employ their persons and goods for the Service of his di∣vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Majestie; they said, we will not go out of our houses with this heat; say to them, hell is much more hot, could you comprehend; they shall laugh at a little in this world, and shall weep much in the other, for a punishment of their sins. If thou meet them, and they demand per∣mission

to go out with thee, to fight for the Faith; say to them, you shall not go out, neither shall ye ever fight a∣gainst the enemy with me, ye were slothfull and cowards the first time, remain with the unbelievers; pray not for them after their death, and stay not at their Tombs, be∣cause they believed neither in God, nor his Prophet, and died in their wickednesse. Be thou not astonished, nei∣ther at the abundance of their wealth, nor the number of their children, God will make use of them, to chastise them in this world, and will destro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them in their impie∣ty. When command was sent to them to believe in God, and fight with his Prophet, the most powerfull among them desired thee to excuse them, and said, Leave us with them that continue in their houses, and desire to remain with the sick, the women, and little children: God har∣dened their hearts, and they shall never learn the truth. The Prophet and true believers that were with them, and fought, and employed their persons, and goods for the Service of God, shall be blessed; he hath prepared for them gardens, wherein flow many rivers, with perfection of felicity. Some of the <HI>Arabians</HI> came to excuse them∣selves of going to the war, and such as renounced God and the Prophet, remained in their houses, but they shall rescent grievous torments, because of their wickedness; the sick, the impotent, and those that want means to be present at the war, offend not God in ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding in their houses, provided they be faithfull to his divine Majestie, and his Prophet. The righteous are not obliged to do but what is in their power, God shall be to them gracious and mercifull. Such as repaired to thee to fight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Benou Mo∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en.</NOTE> and whom thou didst dismiss for want of occasion, did not offend God; they returned to their houses with tears in their eyes, with discontent, to have wanted means to employ in the Service of his divine Majesty; the war is appointed to such as intreat thee to exempt them that are rich, and have wealth to subsist, they require leave to remain with their wives and children, God hath hardned their hearts, and they know it not; they shall come to excuse them∣selves, when thou shalt meet them; Say unto them, excuse

not your selves, I do not believe you, God hath given us to understand your news, he and his Prophet likewise hath rendred your good works vain and unprofitable; ye shall one day appear before him that knoweth what is past, present, and future, he shall cause you to remember what∣soever you have done, and shall punish you according to your demerits. They shall conjure you by the name of God, when you approach them, to depart from them; de∣part from them, they are full of uncleanness, hell shall be their habitation, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e they shall be tormented for their crimes. They shall beseech you to love them; if you love them, know, that God abhorreth them that disobey him: The <HI>Arabians,</HI> who observe not the precepts which God hath sent to his Prophet; are ye more impious and in∣gratefull? God knoweth all things, and is most prudent. There be persons among the <HI>Arabians,</HI> who account it lost money that they expend for the Service of God, and pro∣tract their departure, to retard yours, and make you to attend; the wheel of misery is upon them, God under∣standeth what ever they say, and knoweth all their acti∣ons; there be among them who believe in God, and the day of Judgement; they esteem that their expence for the Service of God draweth them nigh to his divine Majesty, and they invite the Prophet to pray for them, God shall give them his mercy, he is gracious and mercifull to them that obey him. They that first arrived at <HI>Medina,</HI> the first of them that went out of <HI>Mecca,</HI> to depart from the wic∣ked, such as were at the battell of <HI>Beder,</HI> and such as imi∣tated them in well doing, shall injoy the grace of God, he hath prepared for them gardens, wherein flow many rivers, with supreme felicitie. There be <HI>Arabians</HI> about you, and in <HI>Medina,</HI> they affect impietie; you know them not, but I know them all, I will chastise them twice on earth, (to wit, through ignominie and death) and they shall feele in the other world exceeding great torments. Others there bee, that confesse their sinnes, and who doe good and evill works; peradventure God will pardon them, hee is altogether gracious and mer∣cifull; take of their substance for almes, thou shalt render
<PB N="125" REF="73"/>
them righteous and shalt purifie them, pray for them, thy prayers shall procure them the mercy of God, he un∣derstandeth and knoweth all things. Know they not, that God accepteth the conversion of his Creatures, that their almes are pleasing to him, and that he is gracious and mercifull? Say unto them, doe what shall please you; God, his Prophet, and the True-believers shall see what you do, you shall one day appear before him, who know∣eth the present, past, and future; he shall make you to know whatsoever ye have done▪ and shall chastise you af∣ter your demerits. There be others that attend the plea∣sure of God, either his grace, or his wrath, his punish∣ment, or his mercy, God understandeth what is in their soules, and is most wise. They that esteemed, that the Temple built by unbelievers, to seduce the righteous, to distinguish the wicked from the good, and to observe such as had before fought against God, and against his Pro∣phet, is the Temple of his divine Majestie, sweare that they desire to do well, and that their intention is most honest, but they are lyars, and God shall be witnesse of their falshood; make not thy prayers in that Temple, make the prayers in the Temple founded on the fear of God, that is reasonable; there be persons in that Tem∣ple who desire to be purified, God loveth such as have a clean soul; Who is he that buildeth best, he that foundeth his bullding upon the fear of God, or he who layeth the foundation of his building upon the brink of a ditch of sand, which falleth, and ruineth it self? They who e∣steem the Temple built by unbelievers, to seduce the peo∣ple, to be the Temple of God, shall be with that Temple, and with the Infidels that built it, burnt in the fire of Hell; God guideth not the unjust, their building shall serve only to torment them, God knoweth their designe, and is most wise; he purchaseth of True-believers their souls and goods; and giveth them Paradise; if they be slain, or if they slay when they shall fight for the faith, they shall have what he hath promised to them in the Old Testament, the Gospel, and in the <HI>Alcoran:</HI> Who better satisfieth what hee hath promised, then
<PB N="126" REF="74"/>
God, Declare to them, that they have made a good pur∣chase, they have gained the height of felicity. Such as are firme in their faith, who pray, honour, and worship God, who observe his Commandements, and all True-believers, shall enjoy the delights of Paradise, with all manner of content. The Prophet, and True-believers ought not to ask pardon of God for Infidels, notwith∣standing they be their parents, having had knowledge that they are damned, because of their infidelity. <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> prayed not for his father, untill he had promised him to adore one God alone; when hee knew his fa∣ther to be an enemie to God, he declared himselfe an enemy to his sin, he ceased praying for him, although he was exceeding charitable, and patient in his afflictions. God misleadeth not them that he hath put into the right way, he giveth them to understand what they ought to doe, he knoweth them that deserve to be seduced, and such as merit to be guided through the right way. The Kingdome of heaven and Earth is Gods, he giveth life and death to whom he seeth good: Who, except God shall protect you? he hath given his grace to the Pro∣phet, and to such as followed him in his affliction, al∣though it wanted but a little, that the hearts of many of them inclined not to the party of the unbelievers, but he pardoned them; he hath been gracious and mercifull to three persons who deserted the Prophet, and were sor∣ry for their error, they knew there was no sure refuge, but in God, he pardoned them, when they were con∣verted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kiab bin Malik, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lal bin A∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ihe, Mes∣rarhe bin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abin.</NOTE> he is gracious and mercifull to such as repent. Oh ye that believe! feare God, be righteous; the In∣habitants of <HI>Medina</HI> and the <HI>Arabians,</HI> that dwell about that City, ought not to contradict the will of the Pro∣phet of God, neither dislike what he approveth, be∣cause they have endured neither thirst, nor paine, nor anguish for the service of his divine Majesty; they have not been trampled under-foot by their enemies, they shall irritate the Infidels, and shall receive no displea∣sure; on the contrary, they shall acquire merit, and per∣form a good work. God doth not deprive them of recom∣pence
<PB N="127" REF="74"/>
that doe well, he shall write down their expence for his service, and the number of the Idols that they shall destroy, for reward of their good works. It is not necessary that all the faithfull goe to the warre, it is suf∣ficient, that of every lineage, and of every Nation there goe a party, while the rest shall learn the Lawes and mysteries of faith, to instruct their Companions, when they shall return from their voyage, perhaps they will fear the chastisement of God. Oh ye that believe in God▪ fight against them that would cause you to be defiled in impiety, be valiant, and know that God is with them that have his feare before their eyes. When God caused to descend from Heaven, any Chapter of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> some of them said, through disdaine, that will increase the faith of this people. Certainly it aug∣menteth the faith of True-believers, it rejoyceth them▪ and enflameth the wrath of his divine Majesty upon In∣fidels, who persist in their pollutions, and dye in their wickednesse. They know not that God tryeth the good, once, or twice a year, they will not be converted, it is lost time to preach to them. When God sent from Heaven any Chapter of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> they beheld each others, and said, doth any one see us? They returned in their impiety, and God turned their heart from the right way, for that they would not learn the Truth. God hath sent you a Prophet of your own Nation, who, with pas∣sion, desireth to deliver you from your obstinacy, and is extreamly affected to instruct you in the way of Salvati∣on, God is milde, and pitifull towards True-believers. If they abandon the faith, say unto them, God is my protector, there is but one sole God, I recommend my selfe to the will of his divine Majesty, he is the Lord of the Majestique Throne.</P>

The precepts contained in this Book proceed from the Omnipotent: Doth the people wonder that we have inspired a man to preach to the wicked the torments of Hell, and to declare to True-believers, that they shall finde true what their Lord to them hath promi∣sed? The wicked say, that it is but sorcery and enchant∣ment. Certainly God is your Lord, who created Heaven and Earth in six dayes, and sitteth on his Throne, dispo∣sing all things; no man intercedeth for his Neighbour without his permission; he is your God and your Lord, worship him alone, will ye not consider it? you all shall be one day assembled before him; he promised with truth, that he will cause men to die, and raise them again, to re∣compence such as have believed in his Law, and done good works: The unbelievers shall drink a boyling drink, and shall endure great torments, because of their impiety. He it is that gave light to the Sun, and brightness to the Moon, that created the signes to know the number of years, the account of moneths, and of whatsoever he hath created, these things teach with truth, the miracles of his divine Majesty, to such as have knowledge to understand them; the difference of day and of night, and what God hath created in Heaven and in Earth, are marks of his u∣nity to them that have his fear before their eyes. They who believe there is no resurrection, such as place their con∣tent in the wealth of this world, they that trust in their ri∣ches, and that are ignorant of the commandements of God, shal be precipitated into the fire of Hell, because of their sins, and the True-believers shall be conducted by his di∣vine Majesty into delicious gardens, wherin flow many ri∣vers, they shall there find whatsoever they shall desire, and shal say at the beginning of their prayers, praised be God;
<PB N="129" REF="75"/>
afterwards they shall say, Salvation be to God; and at the end of their prayers, prayse be to God, Lord of the Universe. Although God doth sometimes suddenly cha∣stise men, he alwayes attendeth the time of their Destiny. I will leave them that shall not believe in the Resurrecti∣on, in their errors, to their confusion; When man is af∣flicted, he invoketh us standing, sitting, lying, and in all postures, and when we have delivered him from his affli∣ction, he persisteth in his wickedness. It seemeth good to the wicked to do in this manner, we destroyed their Predecessors when they believed not in the Prophets, nei∣ther obeyed the precepts that we sent them, and have esta∣blished you on the Earth in their place after them, to see your deportments. When thou teachest our commande∣ments to them that believe not in the Resurrection; they say, that the precepts of the <HI>Alcoran</HI> are altogether con∣trary to what thou preachest, and that thou hast altered them; Say unto them, I have no will to alter them of my selfe, I do but what is inspired into me of God, I fear to be punished at the day of Judgement, should I disobey his divine Majesty; Say unto them, Had it pleased God, I had neither read, nor taught you his Commandements, I sojourned a long time with you, before I taught you, will you not learn them? Who is more unjust then hee that blasphemeth? God doth not aid the Infidels that worship what can neither benefit nor hurt them, and say, their Idols shall intercede for them; will you instruct God in any thing that he knoweth not, of what is in Heaven or in Earth? Praised be God, he hath no compa∣nion. Men were all of one Religion before Infidelity took place, and if God had not said that he would deferre the punishment of the wicked untill the day of Judgement, he had already destroyed them in this world, because of their impiety; They say, We will not believe in the Prophet, if God make not some miracles to appear in him; Say unto them, God knoweth what shall be; ex∣pect, I will expect with you: when we gave them to taste of content after their affliction, they had subtil∣ty upon our Commandements: Say unto them, God is
<PB N="130" REF="76"/>
more subtile then you, his Messengers shall write your subtilties; he it is that made men to travell upon the earth and sea; It is he that sendeth them a favourable winde to rejoyce them in their ships; when tempest surpriseth them, they believe that the waves will overwhelm them, then they invoke God, with desire to embrace his Law, and say, if God doth deliver us from this danger, wee will believe in his Unity, and return him thanks for this mercy; and being delivered from perill, persist in their wickedness. O people! you draw mischief on your selves, you require nothing but the wealth of this world, you all shall appear before us to be judged according to your works; the life of the world is like to the rain, which we cause to descend from Heaven, it causeth with mixture all sorts of herbage to spring forth, for the nou∣rishment of men, and beasts. When the Earth is adorned with flowers, and enriched with its fruits, the Inhabitants oftentimes believe they have the power to cause their pro∣duction; then send we our chastisements day and night upon the Earth, and render it as mown, and as if the day before it had brought no fruit. Thus do I discover my∣steries to such as have knowledge to comprehend them. They beg their salvation of God; he saveth and putteth in the way of salvation whom it pleaseth him. He shall not cover the visage of them that have done good works, they shall appear without shame, and dwell in Paradise; where they shall remain eternally; and such as shall have done evill shall be punished after their demerits, they shall be covered with shame, and none shall be able to protect them, they shall be as if a great part of the obscu∣rity of the night had covered their countenance, they shall be condemned to the fire of hell, where they shall dwell eternally. Think on the day, wherein we will as∣semble all the world, and will say to the Infidels, hell shall be your habitation; where be the Idols you ado∣red? we have separated you from each other. Their Idols shall say to them, you have not worshipped us, God is witness; was there any thing between us and you, that rendred us ignorant of your adorations? That day shall
<PB N="131" REF="76"/>
every one see what he hath done, and know that God is Truth it self; their Idols shall be separated farre from them, and they shall understand their blasphemies. Say unto them, who enricheth you with the wealth of heaven and earth? Who causeth life to come out of death, and death out of life? Who disposeth all things in the world? They shall answer, it is God: Say unto them, why have you not therefore his fear before your eyes? God is indeed your Lord, what is there after the Truth, but falshood? How will you depart from his Law? his Word shal be accomplished against Infidels. Say unto them, Have your Idols the power to cause men to die, and to rise again; how shall they be able to blaspheme after these reasons? Say unto them, Are your Idols able to conduct you into the right way? God guideth the people into the way of Salvation; who ought rather to be followed, he that gui∣deth the people into the right way, or he that misleadeth them? What reason have ye to follow the evill way; The greatest part of them follow but their own opinion, but their opinion is not conformable to the Truth; God knoweth all their actions, there is no falshood in the <HI>Alco∣ran,</HI> it confirmeth the ancient Scriptures, and perspicuously explaineth them; there is no doubt, but it proceedeth from the Lord of the Universe. They say <HI>Mahomet</HI> hath invented this Book; say unto them, come and bring any thing that resembleth it in Doctrine and Eloquence, and call the Idols which ye adore, we shall see if you are sincere; on the contrary, they have blasphemed, and have talked of what they understood not, when they heard the exposition of the <HI>Alcoran:</HI> Thus did their Prede∣cessours; but consider what is the end of the unjust; There be among them, who will believe in this Book, and others that will not believe; Thy Lord knoweth them that defile the earth; if they slander thee, say unto them, I will answer with my actions, and yee shall answer with yours, yee are innocent of what I act, and I am innocent of what yee doe. There be persons among them that have inclination to heare thee, but art thou able to cause the deafe to heare?
<PB N="132" REF="77"/>
Should they not be deafe, they would learn nothing; O∣thers there be, who look towards thee, but art thou able to guide the blind? should they see clearly, they would not follow the right way; God doth no injustice to men, they doe injury to themselves, through the enor∣mity of their offences. I will cause them to rise again at the day of Judgement, as if they had remained but one houre of a day in the grave; they shall know each other, and the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cked who have not believed in the Resurrecti∣on, shall be damned: I will shew thee many of them whom I will chastise; I will cause thee to die before they be chastised, and they all shall appear before me to be judged; God is witness of their actions, he shall punish them according to their demerits; every Nation of the world hath had a Prophet sent from God, who hath jud∣ged with reason, and without injustice, the differences that were among them touching Religion: They have said, at what time shall the wrath of God appear? Say unto them, I, of my selfe, can neither procure good nor evill, if God doth not permit it; every one hath his de∣stiny, when the time of their destiny arriveth, they can neither retard, or advance it one hour. Have ye conside∣red the punishment which God heretofore sent, by day, and by night against the wicked? When ye felt it, ye be∣lieved it, and fell into it headlong. It shall be said to the wicked at the day of Judgement, tast eternall torments; shall you not be punished according to your demerits? They will ask of thee, if the pains denounced against the wicked, and if the Resurrection be matters of truth? Say unto them, yes, my Lord is most exact in his words, and all the treasures of the world shall not be able to redeem one soul. They shal repent of their sins, when they shall feel the punishment of their offences, but shal be condemned with∣out injustice; whatsoever is in heaven and in earth apper∣taineth to God, he is exact in his promise, yet the greatest part of the world do not know him. He it is who causeth to die, and giveth life, and shall assemble men at the day of Judgement. O people! God hath sent you instructions, and remedies for your infirmities; he hath sent a guide to
<PB N="133" REF="77"/>
conduct true-believers into the way of his mercy; it shall be to them of more advantage, then the treasures that they accumulate: Have ye considered the good things which he hath created for you? Ye have appointed one part to be eaten, and have prohibited to eate of another: Hath God permitted you to blaspheme against him? The opi∣nion of such as blaspheme against God, shall be but mi∣sery at the day of Judgement; God is full of goodnesse for the people, but most of them are ingratefull. In whatso∣ever place thou art, whether thou teach what is contained in the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> or whether thou labour, I am alwayes present, nothing is concealed from thy Lord, of what∣soever is in heaven and earth; be it great or litle, all is written in the intelligible Booke, that explaineth all things. There needeth no feare for such as recommend themselves to God, they shall be exempt from the pains of hell. The true-believers who have his feare before their eyes, shall suffer no torments in the other world; it is declared to them on earth, that they shall have all con∣tent, the word of God admits of no alteration; they shall enjoy perfection of felicity in Paradise. Afflict not thy self for the words of the impious, vertue proceedeth from God, he understandeth, and knoweth all things; what∣soever is in heaven and in earth appertaineth to him: They who worship Idols, follow but their opinion, and are lyars; God hath created the night for repose, and the day for labour; such as heare his Word, find therein marks of his omnipotency. They have said, doe ye believe that God hath a Son? Praised be God, he is most rich, and hath no need of any person, he possesseth whatsoever is in heaven, and earth; you have no reason in what ye alledge; will you speak of God what ye know not? God doth not aide in this world them that blaspheme against him, he shall cause them to feele after their death great torments, because of their impiety: Instruct them in the History of <HI>Noah,</HI> how he spake to his people, and said, O people! if my abode with you, &amp; the preaching of the Commandments of God, be irksom to you, know, that all my support is in God; assemble your Doctors, with your Idols, &amp; conceal not what
<PB N="134" REF="78"/>
ye doe; goe whither you will, ye shall find none to pro∣tect you; if ye contemne my instructions, I require not of you a reward for my pains; I desire to receive of none other then God the Omnipotent, and recommend my self to the Mill of his divine Majesty. They slandered <HI>Noah,</HI> then did we save him in the Arke, and them that were with him; we prolonged their posterity on earth, and drowned the wicked; consider the end of such as heard the word of God, and contemned it. We sent to them o∣ther Prophets after <HI>Noah,</HI> they made them to see miracles, and gave them most salutary instructions; but they did not believe in what they had no will before to believe. Thus I harden the heart of the wicked. We after them, sent <HI>Moses</HI> to <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> and his subjects, without miracles, they arose against our Commandements, when the truth was preached to them, and said, it was but Magick and enchantment. <HI>Moses</HI> said to them, will you say that the Truth is Sorcery? God doth not assist Magicians and Sorcerers; they said, Art thou, with thy brother, come to divert us from the Religion of our Fathers, and to be esteemed on earth? We will believe in thy words. Then <HI>Pharaoh</HI> commanded to summon the most skilfull of his Magicians; they being assembled, <HI>Moses</HI> said to them, cast downe what yee have a will to cast downe on the ground; having cast downe their cords and staves, <HI>Mo∣ses</HI> said to them, know ye none other thing but Magick? God shall render it vaine, and unprofitable; he abhor∣reth such as defile the earth, he confirmeth the Truth through his Word, although it be against the will of the wicked. Few men believed in <HI>Moses,</HI> because of their feare to displease <HI>Pharoah,</HI> and his Ministers. <HI>Pharoah</HI> was powerfull on earth, and in the number of the wicked. <HI>Moses</HI> said, O people! if ye believe in God, resign your selves to his will; they answered, All our confidence is in God; Lord, doe not thou abandon us to the malice of the unjust: deliver us through thy mercy from the hands of Infidels. We inspired <HI>Moses</HI> and his brother to dwell some time in <HI>Egypt</HI> with their people, and to make Ora∣tories in their houses, therein to make their prayers, and
<PB N="135" REF="78"/>
Preach to true believers. Lord, said <HI>Moses,</HI> thou hast en∣riched <HI>Pha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oah</HI> and his people in this world; they goe a∣stray from the way of thy Law; confound their riches, and harden their hearts, they will not believe untill they see thy judgements, and feel the effect of thy wrath; he said, I h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e heard the prayers of you both; be faithfull in your Embassie, and follow not the way of the igno∣rant. We gave passage through the sea to the children of <HI>Israel; Pharoah</HI> pursued them with hatred and envy, untill his people were drowned. Then said <HI>Pharoah,</HI> I believe there is none other God, but the God of the children of <HI>Israel,</HI> and I wholly recommend my self to his Will. Thou dost now believe in God, O <HI>Pharoah</HI>! and wert before disobedient to his Commandements, filling the earth with thy enormities, I have delivered thee from this pe∣rill, that thou maist be an example to posterity; for ma∣ny among the people are ignorant of my omnipotency. We gave the Children of Israell to dwell in places full of delights, and enriched them with the good things of the Earth, they knew the differences that arose among them touching Religion, thy Lord shall judge them at the day of Judgement. If thou doubtest what we have taught thee, repaire to them that have read the Scripture before thee; what thy Lord hath taught thee is most true; be not thou of them that doubt, neither of such as derogate from the Commandements of God, thou shalt be in the number of the wretched. Those whom God will chastise, shall not believe in his divine Majesty, should they behold all the miracles of the world, untill they see the torments of Hell. The faith is exceeding profitable to the Cities that have received it; when the Inhabitants of the City of <HI>Jonas</HI> embraced it, we delivered them from our punish∣ment, we delivered them from ignominy, and enriched them, untill the time appointed; if it pleased thy Lord, all the world should believe in him; wilt thou abhorre the people untill they believe in God? No man can em∣brace the faith with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut his permission, he sendeth his in∣dignation against them that disobey his Commande∣ments: Say unto them, Consider all that is in Heaven
<PB N="136" REF="79"/>
and Earth, miracles and preaching are of no use to such as will not believe; shall they expect what their Prede∣cessors expected? Say unto them, expect, I will expect with you. I will deliver my Prophets, and the True-be∣lievers, from the torments of Hell, it is reasonable that I deliver them that obey my Commandements. Oh peo∣ple! who causeth you to doubt of the Law which I teach you? I will not worship the Idols that you adore, I wor∣ship one God alone, who shall cause you all to dye; I will embrace his Law, it commandeth to professe his Unity, I am not of them that say, he hath a companion equall to him. Adore not what can neither benefit nor hurt thee, if thou doe it, thou shalt be in the number of the unjust. If God will afflict thee, none can deliver thee from af∣fliction; if God will doe good to thee, none can deprive thee of his grace, he hath given it to whom seemeth good to himself, he is gracious and mercifull. Oh people! God teacheth you the truth; whosoever shall follow the right way, shall save his soule, and whosoever shall go a∣stray, shall destroy it. I am not your Tutor, I do but what is inspired into me; I have patience in my perseverance, I wil expect the Judgement of God, there is no better Judge then he.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. The Chapter of <HI>Hod,</HI> containing an hundred twenty and three Verses, written at <HI>Mecca.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the name of God gracious and mercifull. I am the mercifull God. The signs contained in this Booke are most true, they proceed from the most wise, who knoweth all things. Worship ye but one God alone, I preach to you from him the torments of Hell, and declare the joyes of Paradise, that ye may implore pardon of his divine Majesty, and be converted; he shall give you an happy life in the world, untill the time appointed, and shall reward every one according to his works. I feare, lest you should be
<PB N="137" REF="79"/>
chastised at the day of Judgement; if you forsake the right way, you all shall be assembled before God to be judged. The heart of the impious inclined to hatred of the Pro∣phet, and they would have concealed themselves for some time from God; they are covered with their garments, that they may not be knowne, but God knoweth what is in their soules, he understandeth whatsoever they con∣ceale, and whatsoever they make manifest. All the Crea∣tures of the world live of his grace, he knoweth the place of their repaire, and the place where they must dye, all is written in an intelligible booke, that explaineth all things. He it is that created Heaven and Earth in six days,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Kitab el tenoir.</HI></NOTE> his Throne was before upon the waters, (the <HI>Alcoran</HI>) ex∣horteth you to wel-doing. If thou saist to the wicked, that they shall rise againe after their death, they will say, it is but witchcraft and sorcery; if retard some time to chastise them, they say, there is no punishment for their crimes; but they shall not avoid it, in the day when it shall appeare, and they shall feel the rigour of the paines which they contemne. If we conferre riches, and health on the impious, and deprive them of them, they dispaire in their impiety; if we give them good after their evill, they say, misery hath forsaken them, they rejoyce, and be∣come arrogant. Such as are humble and patient in their afflictions, and doe good works, shall obtaine pardon of their sinnes, and a very great reward. Perhaps thou wilt forget to teach something of what I have inspired into thee, and be afflicted, because they say that what thou speakest shall bring thee no profit. Certainly, thou art sent only to reprove them of their sin, thy Lord is om∣nipotent, and shall chastise them after their demerits. Assuredly, they will say, thou hast <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Contro∣ve supra.</NOTE> forged the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and that it is of thy invention; Say unto them, come and bring with you ten Chapters of your invention, like to the <HI>Alcoran</HI> in instruction and Eloquence, and call to your aid the Idols that ye adore; if you be righteous, if they hear not your prayers, neither afford you succors, know then, that the <HI>Alcoran</HI> descended from Heaven, through Gods permission, &amp; that there is but one sole God, wil yet not trust in him? I wil
<PB N="138" REF="80"/>
bestow the riches and honours of the Earth, on many per∣sons that affect them, and in the end they shall be confi∣ned in the fire of Hell, and the good works that they shall doe in this world, shall be unprofitable in the other. They who observe what God hath ordained, study the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and believe that it proceedeth from his divine Majesty, to teach the right way, and to obtain his mercy, as before it, was the book of <HI>Moses.</HI> Such as shall believe in the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> shall be happy, doubtlesse the fire of Hell is prepared for the Infidels who will not believe therein, but the greatest part of the world is incredulous: who is more impious then they that blaspheme against God? Such men shall not see his face; the Angels shall say, at the day of Judgement, behold them that have been impi∣ous, a curse is upon them, and upon the unjust that have mislead the people from the right way, they were indeed Infidels. Such men shall not escape the punishment of their crimes on Earth, they shall find none that is able to protect them but God, he shall augment their paines, because they would not abandon their wickednesse, nei∣ther receive the light of faith. Such are miserable men, their Idols shall not afford them succors, they doubtlesse shall be eternally damned: and such as shall believe in God, doe good works, and be converted, shall dwell for ever in Paradise. The wicked are as deaf, and blind, and the True believers are like those who have good sight and perfect hearing; shall they be in paralell to each other? will ye never consider it? We sent <HI>Noah</HI> to reprove men for their sinnes, he said to them, worship but one God alone, otherwise I feare ye shall be chastised at the day of Judgement; The Doctors of the Infidels answered him, we see thee to be a man, like us, and that such as follow thee are poore people, blind, and without coun∣sell; we perceive not that thou hast any grace, that ought to preferre thee to us; contrariwise, we believe thee to be a lyar; he said, oh people! know ye not that God hath taught me what I preach to you, that he hath given me the grace of Prophecie, and deprived you of it? shall I exhort you to acknowledge his grace, seeing ye abhorre
<PB N="139" REF="80"/>
him? Oh people! I require no recompense of you for my paines, God will reward me largely. I desire not to ba∣nish True-believers from my company, they shall one day appeare before their Lord, but I perceive that ye are ig∣norant. Oh people! who shall hinder God to punish me, if I abuse True-believers? Will ye not consider it? I say not that I possesse the treasures of God, I know not what shall be; I say not that I am an Angell, I say not to them whom you contemne, that God shall enrich them, God knoweth what is in their souls; should I maintaine such discourse, I should have great blame. They said, oh <HI>Noah</HI>! we have a long time disputed together; if thou art sin∣cere, let us see the paines which thou preachest to us; God, said he, when it shall please him, shall cause you to see them, you shall not escape them, my instructions shall be to you unprofitable; if God will prove you, he is your Lord, and you shall one day be assembled before him to be judged. Will the unbelievers say, that thou hast for∣ged the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and that it is of thine invention? Say unto them, if I have invented it, sinne will be upon me, and I am innocent of your blasphemies, God inspired in∣to <HI>Noah,</HI> that none should believe in his words, but such as had already believed in him: He said unto him, build an Arke conformable to the inspiration that we have sent thee, but speak no more to me of the unjust, they shall be drowned; the passengers derided him and his Arke; he said to them, ye scoffe at me, I will laugh at you, and we shall see them that shall best understand; he whom God shall chastise, shall be covered with shame, and perpe∣tually tormented. When our will was to destroy that peo∣ple, and the light of the morning appeared, and the wa∣ter boyled in <HI>Noah's</HI> pot, we commanded him to charge his Arke with two beasts of every kind and Species; all creatures were destroyed, except those, of which we be∣fore made mention, as well such as believed, as them that did not believe, and that but a few: <HI>Noah</HI> said unto them, ascend the Arke in the name of God, who shall cause it to swimme, and to anchor; the Lord is gracious and mer∣cifull towards us. When the Arke began to flote, like to
<PB N="140" REF="81"/>
a Mountaine, <HI>Noah</HI> called to one of his sonnes who stayed on the Earth, and said, my <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Gelal∣ldin</HI> saith that he was called <HI>Ki∣nan.</HI></NOTE> sonne, come up into the Arke with us, and remaine not with the Infidels; he answered, I will ascend an high mountaine, that shall save me from the waters; <HI>Noah</HI> said to him, none is able this day to deliver thee from the punishment of God, if it be not through his mercy; The waters being risen, he was in the number of them that were drowned: God com∣manded the Earth to drinke its water, and the Heavens to poure downe no more raine; the water diminished up∣on the Earth, after the people were drowned, and the Arke rested upon the Mountaine called <HI>Gioudy</HI>; thus were the unjust extirpated; <HI>Noah</HI> prayed to his Lord, and said, Lord, my son that remained in the waters was of my li∣neage, thou didst promise me to save my family, thou dost exactly performe thy promise, thou art true in thy words, and most just in thine actions: Oh <HI>Noah</HI>! answe∣red <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od, that son is not of thy lineage, he hath offended me, and disobeyed my Commandements, doe not enquire of me concerning that which thou oughtest not to know, otherwise thou shalt be in the number of the ignorant: Lord, said <HI>Noah,</HI> I will take heed, through thine assistance, to enquire of thee what I ought not to know, if thou hast not pitie on me, I shall be in the number of the misera∣ble. God said, oh <HI>Noah</HI>! descend from the Arke with Salvation, and blessing upon thee, and upon a part of them that are with thee; I will enrich the other part with the wealth of this world, to punish them most se∣verely at the day of Judgement. I teach what shall be, what neither thou, nor thy people have not yet knowne; be patient in thine afflictions, Paradise is for them that have my feare before their eyes. Wee sent <HI>Hod</HI> to the peo∣ple of <HI>Aad,</HI> his brother; he said unto them, oh people! adore but one God alone, otherwise ye shall be in the number of Infidels, I require of you no recompense for the paines I take in preaching to you, he that created me, shall reward me; will ye never be wise? implore pardon of God, be converted, and obey his divine will, he shall send you raine from Heaven, and shall encrease your
<PB N="141" REF="81"/>
strength, and riches, be not in the number of the wicked; they answered, oh <HI>Hod</HI>! thou shewest us no reasons to prove thy sayings, thy words shall not make us to quit our Gods, we give no credit to thy discourse, and tell thee, that some one of our Gods shall severely chastise thee; He said, take God and your selves to w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tnesse that I am innocent of the sinne that you commit, in adoring Idols; if you conspire against me, none shall be able to protect you at the day of Judgement, I recommend my selfe to the will of God, mine and your Lord, he conserveth all the cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣tures of the Earth, and loveth them that follow the right way. I have discharged my duty and commission, I have taught you what God commanded me, if you goe astray, he shall establish another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eople in your place, you do him no harme through your impiety, he exactly observeth whatsoever is done in the world. When we destroyed that p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ople, we by our speciall grace delivered <HI>Hod</HI> from their malice, and all the True-believers that were with him, we delivered them from great affliction.

We sent <HI>Salhe</HI> to <HI>Temod,</HI> his brother, and his people; he said to them, oh p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ople! worsh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p one God a∣lone, he it is who hath created you of the dust of the earth, and filled it with many sorts of fruits, that you might inhabit it; beg pardon of him, and be converted, he hearkneth to his creatures, and heareth their prayers: they answered, oh <HI>Salhe</HI>! it was hoped thou wouldst have beene our Captaine, before the prohibit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on was made, to adore the Gods of our fathers, wee exceedingly doubt of what thou preachest; Oh people! said <HI>Sal∣he,</HI> know ye not that God taught me what to you I preach, and that he hath given me his grace? who shall protect me if I disobey him?

O ye of the family of <HI>Abraham</HI>! God hath given you his bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssing, praise and glory are due to him in all places. When <HI>Abraham</HI> was freed from his feare, and they having announced the birth of his children, he disputed with them a long time, touching the inhabitants of the City of <HI>Lot</HI>; he was of a mild disposition; and frequently repeated the pra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses of God.

When they arri∣ved in <HI>Lots</HI> house, he was grieved, in that he was not able to secure them from the insolency of the people; he said, behold here a day extremly difficult to passe; The inhabi∣tants of the City having knowledge of their arrival, repai∣red to <HI>Lots</HI> house to continue their filthiness: <HI>Lot</HI> said unto them, O people!

you, feare God, trouble me not, abuse not my guests; is there none among you to shew you your error! They an∣swered, thou well knowest that we have nothing to doe with thy daughters, thou knowest what we require; he said, were I of sufficient power, I would dwell in a fortified place to avoid the assaults of your malice: Then said the Messengers of God unto him, O <HI>Lot</HI>! we are Angels sent from God, those villains shall not approach thee, go this night out of the City with thy family, none shall look back but thy wife, she shall feel the punishment prepared for the wicked, they shall be punished early in the morning; be gone speedily, the day approacheth; when we destroy∣ed them, we turned the City upside downe, and caused it to raine upon them stones, marked with fire, to confound them. Such chastisement is not far from the Infidels (that are in <HI>Mecca</HI>) We sent <HI>Chaib</HI> into the Country of <HI>Madian,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Kitab el tenoir,</HI> and <HI>Gelal∣din.</HI></NOTE> he said, O people! Worship one God alone; weigh with good weights, and measure with good measure; detain no∣thing from your neighbour, and defile not the earth, if ye believe in God, otherwise I feare you may be punished at the day of Judgement; the little that shall remaine, shall bring you more of content then all that ye can purloin, in weighing with false weight, and measuring with false mea∣sure. I am not sent to be your Tutor, but only to declare the word of God: they said, O <HI>Chaib,</HI> doth thy Law en∣joyne us to abandon the gods of our Fathers, and hinder us to make of our goods what shall seeme good to us? thou art not of an humour good enough to be our Director. He said, O people! see ye not that God hath taught me what I preach? He hath given me wealth for subsistance: I contradict you in nothing but what is forbidden you, I will doe nothing but what is reasonable, and conform the most I shal be able to Justice; my whole support is in God, I recommend my selfe to the will of his divine Majesty, before which I must one day appeare. O people! take heed least ye become criminall, if ye forsake the company of the righteous, and lest that befall you, that hapned to them who would not believe <HI>Noah, Hod, Salhe,</HI> and <HI>Lot</HI>; the pu∣nishment of God is not far from you, beg pardon of him.

and be converted, he is mercifull and amiable. They said, O <HI>Chaib</HI>! we understand not all that thou sayest; we see thee amongst us without force and power; wert thou not accompanied, we would stone thee; thou shalt have no dominion over us. He said, O people! esteeme ye my company, and feare ye it more then God? Have ye tur∣ned the back towards him? He knoweth all your actions, live after your own manner, I will live after mine, you shall hereafter know your error; he whom God will cha∣stise, shall remaine in perpetuall misery, you shall soon understand who shall be the lyar, you or I; expect the issue, I will expect with you: when we commanded to de∣stroy them, we (through our especiall grace) preserved <HI>Chaib,</HI> and the true-believers that were with him; thun∣der surprized those wicked ones, and they in the mor∣ning remained dead, extended as carkases in their hou∣ses.

and so long as it shall please God, who doth as see∣meth good to himself. The happy shall enjoy Paradise, where they shall abide eternally, so long as earth and hea∣ven shall endure, and so long as it shall please God. Doubt not what the unbelievers worship, they adore but the I∣dols which their Fathers worshipped; assuredly I will chastise them as their Fathers were chastised. <HI>Moses</HI> prea∣ched the old Testament, yet did the wicked contradict his Precepts; had not God said that he will not punish them, untill the day of Judgement, he had already destroyed them, because they are in an exceeding great error; thy Lord shall reward every one according to his works, he knoweth all their actions. Observe exactly what hath been commanded you, with them that are converted; trans∣gresse not the Law of God, he beholdeth whatsoever you doe. Incline not to the affections of the unjust, lest the fire of hell surprise you, and you be deprived of protecti∣on. Pray to God evening and morning, and a part of the night; prayers blot out sins; it is the doctrine of Prea∣chers; be patient, and persevere, God will not deprive the righteous of their reward: He prohibited your Prede∣cessors and their posterity to defile the earth; neverthelesse there were few among them that abstained; the unjust acted what ever pleased them, and were guilty before God: He shall not destroy <HI>Mecca,</HI> if the Inhabitants there∣of obey his Commandements; and if it pleased him, the whole world should be of one Religion, they to whom he giveth his grace, transgresse not his Will, his Word shall be accomplished, and hell shall be filled with devills, and the wicked of all Nations. They have recounted to thee, and thou understandest whatsoever things are necessary for them, and what the Prophets have heretofore taught; thine heart hath been strengthened, they containe the truth, and they shall be for a lesson to true believers. Say unto Infidels, doc, on your part as ye shall understand, we will doe on our part as we understand, and attend the is∣sue, we will attend it with you; whatsoever is in heaven, and in earth appertains to God, all men shall be assembled before him, worship him, resign your selves to his Will, he knoweth whatsoever the people doth.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. The Chapter of <HI>Joseph,</HI> containing an hundred and thirteene Verses, written at <HI>Mecca.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the Name of God, gracious and mercifull. I am the mercifull God. These signes are the signes of the Booke which distinguisheth good from evill. We have caused to discend from heaven the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> writ∣ten in the <HI>Arabique</HI> tongue, peradventure yee will learne it. I deliver unto thee in the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> one of the best things that I have inspired into thee. Thou were before the comming thereof, in the number of the ignorant. Remember thou, that <HI>Joseph</HI> said to his fa∣ther, My father, I saw in a dreame eleven Stars, the Sunne, and the Moone, I saw them adoring me. My sonne, said his father, discover not thy dreame to thy brothers, they will conspire against thee, the devill is an open enemy to men, thou shalt be elected of the Lord in this world, he shall teach thee the explication of Dreams, he shall accomplish his grace upon thee, and upon the li∣neage of <HI>Jacob,</HI> as he did accomplish it upon thy fathers, <HI>Abraham,</HI> and <HI>Isaac</HI>; the Lord knoweth all things, and is most wise. The History of <HI>Ioseph</HI> shall serve for example to posterity; remember thou, how his brothers said, our father loveth our brother <HI>Ioseph</HI> more then all us toge∣ther, he is in an exceeding great error, let us kill <HI>Ioseph,</HI> and cast him into some secret place remote from us, his ab∣sence will render the face of our father more gentle to∣wards us; after his death we will be converted. One of them said, you shall not doe well to kill him but cast him into the well, some passengers will take him, and carry him into an unknowne Countrie: They said to their Father, Father, wherefore doest thou not send <HI>Ioseph</HI> into the Fields with us? Wee will bee very car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>full, hee shall sport and recreate himselfe; I feare, said hee, that yee will neglect to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eserve

him; dost thou feare (said they) that a wolf should de¦voure him in our presence, and that we want strength to defend him? In the morning they led him with them, and cast him into a Well. We inspired him to prophesie to them what should befall them for the mischief they acted, but they wanted knowledge to comprehend it; they in the evening returned to their fathers house, with eyes full of dissembled teares, and said unto him, father, we sported, and ran who should run the best, <HI>Ioseph</HI> re∣mained with our baggage, a wolf came that devoured him; thou wilt not believe us although we speak the truth; then they shewed him his shirt, which they had sprinkled with blood; it is you that hath done it, said he, you shall an∣swer it before God, he is my protector, and was patient, without lamenting. There past that day <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The <HI>Le∣vantins</HI> well; a <HI>Caravan,</HI> a number of persons travelling together.</NOTE> a <HI>Caravan</HI> near to that Well, who desiring to draw water to drink, let downe a bucket, on which <HI>Ioseph</HI> took hold to get out; they gave him cloathes, led him away secretly, and sold him at a good rate for ready money; they would not kill him, in which they were honest men. He that bought him in <HI>Egypt</HI> commanded his wife to have care of him, that he might one day be usefull for their service, and be to them instead of a son. Thus did we establish <HI>Ioseph</HI> in the coun∣try of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and taught him the exposition of dreams, thy Lord is Omnipotent, but few men know him: when <HI>Ioseph</HI> came to the age of manhood, we gave him knowledge and prudence; thus doe we reward the righteous. His Ma∣sters wife became amorous of his beauty, she one day shut him into her chamber, and solicited him with love; God defend me (said he) to betray my Master, and be unchaste (he was in the number of the righteous) and fled to the door; his Mistrisse ran after him, and to stay him, tore his shirt through the back: she met her husband behind the door, to whom she said, what other thing doth he me∣rit, who would dishonour thine house, then to be impri∣soned, and severely chastised? Lord, said <HI>Ioseph</HI> she sol∣licited me, that infant which is in the cradle, and of thy parentage shall be witnesse: Then the infant in the cradle said, if <HI>Iosephs</HI> shirt be torne before, she hath spoken
<PB N="148" REF="85"/>
truth, and <HI>Ioseph</HI> is a lyar; if the shirt be rent behind, <HI>Iosep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> hath delivered the truth, and she a lye: then her husband b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>held <HI>Iosephs</HI> shirt torne behind, and knew that it was extreame malice, and said to <HI>Ioseph,</HI> take heed to thy self, and beware this act be not divulged: doe thou, speaking to his wife, implore pardon for thy fault, thou art truly guilty. The women of the City, said among themselves, that the rich mans wife was amorous of his Slave, and that she had sollicited his love, and had erred from the right way, which she understanding, made them an exceeding fair feast, and caused <HI>Ioseph</HI> to enter the Parlour where they sate; while they carved their meat, they were so surprised, and entangled with <HI>Iosephs</HI> beau∣ty, that they instead of carving their meat, cut their fin∣gers. O God! said they, this is not a man, but an Angel; then said she unto them, behold him whom I loved with so much passion: she another time importuned him, to sa∣tisfie her desire, and perceiving that he would not con∣descend to her will, menaced him with the prison, and to make him miserable: O God! said <HI>Ioseph,</HI> I had rather be a prisoner, then do what she desireth, deliver me from her malice, defend me from inclining to her lubricity, and from being in the number of the wicked: his Lord heard his prayer, he understandeth and knoweth all things. This woman seeing <HI>Iosephs</HI> resolution, judged it requisite to imprison him for some time; he was put pri∣soner with two men, one of which told him that he had dreamed that he prest grapes to make wine; the other said, that he dream'd that he caried bread upon his head, which the birds did eat, they demanded of him the interpretati∣on of their dreams, because he seemed to them to be a good man: he said to them before ye break fast, I wil inter∣pret your dreams. I wil first tell you what God hath taught me, and how I quit, &amp; abandon the law of Infidels, &amp; em∣brace the Law of our fathers, <HI>Abraham, Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Iacob,</HI> we ought not worship many gods; such as believe in the unity of God, are endued with his grace, but few men give him thanks. O Prisoners! who hath more power, Idols, or one sole God, who is omnipotent? The gods which ye adore are
<PB N="149" REF="85"/>
but Idols, whom ye and your fathers call by such a name, as seemeth good to you, ye have no reason to worship them; God doth not enjoyn you th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, he commandeth you to wor∣ship him alone; this is the right way, but the greatest part of the world, of this are ignorant. O prisoners! the one of you shall give wine to drink to his Master, the other shall be hanged, the birds shall feed on his head, the interpre∣tation that ye have required shall be accomplished. He be∣sought him that should be saved, to remember him when he should be neer to his Master; but the devill caused him to lose the remembrance of <HI>Ioseph,</HI> who remained prisoner, the space of nine years: At that time the King of <HI>Egypt</HI> saw in a dream seven fat kine, which seven lean kine de∣voured; and seven green eares of corn, with seven drie eares, of which he required the interpretation of his Do∣ctors; they answered, that the dream was very obscure, and that they knew not the interpretation; the prisoner that had been set at liberty, said, that he would forthwith give the interpretation of the dream, remembred <HI>Ioseph,</HI> and calling him unto him, said, O righteous man! ex∣plain unto us what is the signification of seven fat kine, de∣voured by seven leane, and seven green eares of corn, and as many dry, peradventure I shall return to the King and his people, and they shall understand the interpretation of this dream. <HI>Ioseph</HI> said to him, yee shall sow the earth seven years following, which shall abound in fruits, pre∣serve your Harvest in the ears, and take only what shall be necessary for life; after this, there shall come seven years barren, and unfruitfull, in which the people shall suffer much. The King of <HI>Egypt</HI> having learned the interpretati∣on of this dream, commanded to call <HI>Ioseph</HI>; the Messenger said unto him, O <HI>Ioseph</HI>! return to thy Master, and require of him the meaning of the women who did cut their fin∣gers, he hath knowledge of their malice, hath caused them to assemble, and demanded of them what was their designe, when they solicited thee with love; they an∣swered, they knew no sinne in thee, and his wife confes∣sed the truth, saying, she had importuned thee, but that thou art a very just man. <HI>Ioseph</HI> answered, by this it appears
<PB N="150" REF="86"/>
that I am no traitor to my Master in his absence, God gui∣deth not traitors; I will not say I am a man without sin, the spirit of man inclineth to evill, except such to whom God hath given his particular grace, he is gracious and mercifull to whom seemeth good to him. The King having talked with <HI>Joseph,</HI> entred him into the number of his do∣mesticks, and made him superintendent of his <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">All the revenues of the Crown.</NOTE> revenews, because he knew him to be a man of spirit, faithfull, and thrifty. We, by our speciall grace, establish <HI>Joseph</HI> in the Country of <HI>Egypt,</HI> where he did what seemeth good to him. I deprive not the righteous of their reward on earth, the recompence of the other world is yet greater for them that believe in my Law, and have my fear before their eyes. The brethren of <HI>Joseph</HI> returned to buy corn; he said to them, when ye shall come again, bring with you your yong brother by the father, you shall find I will make you good measure, and lodge well my guests; if you bring him not, there shall be no corn for you, approach not this kingdom without him: They answered, Lord, his father loveth him exceedingly, nevertheless we shall endeavour to perform what thou enjoynest us; he commanded his servants to put their money for corn in the bottoms of his brethrens sacks, perhaps said he, they will return, or ac∣knowledge this favour when they shall come into their Country. When they arrived at their father, they said, Fa∣ther, there is no more corn for us, if our young brother go not with us, if he go thither we shall have good mea∣sure, and we will be carefull of him. You will be carefull, said he, as you were heretofore of your brother <HI>Joseph</HI>; God wil defend him better then you, he the merciful of the mercifull. When they poured forth their corn, they found their money at the bottomes of their sacks, and said, our father, what shall we desire more, our money is restored to us, and we have bread for our family, permit that our brother go with us, we shall have better measure, that is a small thing to the King of <HI>Egypt</HI>; I will not send him with you, unlesse ye all sweare before God to bring him back again, if there be no great impediment. They swore to fulfill his will; then said he, I take God to be witness of
<PB N="151" REF="86"/>
your oath: O my sons! enter not all together into the City, but go in at severall gates, to the end the people may not be jealous of you; God commandeth what to him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eemeth good, I rely on him, all true believers ought to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esign themselves to his divine will; they entred the Ci∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y as their father enjoyned them, to content him; be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng arrived before <HI>Joseph,</HI> he took his little brother by the hand, and said to him, trouble not thy self for what shall become of thy brethren; having filled their sacks, he cau∣sad a Cup adorned with precious stones to be put into the sack of his little brother; caused it to be given out, that they of the <HI>Caravan</HI> had stolne the Kings Cup; and sent men after them to search; those strangers protested they saw it not, and that they came not into <HI>Egypt</HI> to steal, that they were sureties for each other, and that he who had stolne it deserved punishment. The Cup was found in the sack of his young brother; he caused him to be appre∣hended, and accused them all of theft; Lord, said they, his father is old, he will be extreamly afflicted for his ab∣sence, take one of us in his place, thou shalt in the end find us to be honest men: God forbid, said he, that I should detain other then him who was found guilty of theft, that would be injustice; finding themselves out of hope to free their brother, they saved themselves in a secret place re∣mote from the City; where the eldest said to his brethren, you know the oath we took at our departure, and how heretofore we intreated <HI>Joseph,</HI> I will not go out of <HI>Egypt</HI> without my fathers permission, God is most just, he shall dispose of me and my brother as shall please him, return to your father, and say unto him, thy son was taken in theft, we saw him, and endeavoured to our power to de∣liver him, they of the <HI>Caravan</HI> shall be witnesses. <HI>Jacob</HI> said at their return, they were the cause of that accident, that did not displease you; and he took patience, saying, God perhaps will favour my sons to return in health; he knoweth in what condition I am, he is most prudent in what he ordaineth. He retired from among his sons ex∣treamly afflicted, and bewayled the losse of his son <HI>Joseph</HI>; had his eyes continually covered with tears, and he bore
<PB N="152" REF="87"/>
in his heart great sorrow. His sons said unto him, Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thou yet remember <HI>Ioseph,</HI> to adde to thy grief, and ha∣sten thine end? I am (said he) extreamly desolate, I leave all to the will of God; he hath taught me what ye know not. My sonnes return into <HI>Egypt,</HI> and inquire t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣dings of your two brethren; dispair not of the Spirit of God, none dispaire of Gods Spirit, but the wicked. When they came unto <HI>Ioseph,</HI> they said unto him, The famine that is in our Country, hath extreamly afflicted us, it hath often constrained us to come to buy Corn; thou, of thy favour, hast made us good measure; thou hast caused our money to be restored for alms, God will reward thee, he recompenceth such as are Alms-givers. He said unto them, Ye remember what ye did unto your brother <HI>Ioseph:</HI> They replyed, Certainly thou art not <HI>Ioseph.</HI> I am <HI>Ioseph,</HI> said he, and behold my brother <HI>Ben∣jamin.</HI> God hath given us his grace; he rewardeth him that hath his fear before his eyes, and is patient in his afflictions; he depriveth not the righteous of recompence. God, said they, hath poured his favours upon us in saving thee, whom we have exceedingly offended. Be not (said he) ashamed, God this day pardoneth you that sinne, he is gracious and mercifull; return to your Father, and bear to him this shirt, cast it upon his face, hee shall re∣cover sight, and return hither with him, and with your whole family. The <HI>Caravan</HI> was then halfe way upon re∣turn, when <HI>Iacob</HI> said to them that attended him, I smell the odor of my sonne <HI>Ioseph</HI>; you deride me, but what I speak is most true: They told him, that he was still in his old error; some dayes following, one of his sonnes arrived with tidings of <HI>Ioseph</HI>; and cast the shirt that he had given him, upon him; and incontinently he recove∣red his sight, and said, Did I not alwayes tell you, that I knew what ye knew not; they said, Our Father pardon us, and ask the forgiveness of God for us, who have ex∣ceedingly offended him: He answered, I will beg par∣don of God for you, he is gracious and mercifull. When they arrived before <HI>Ioseph,</HI> he took his Father by the hand, saying, Enter without feare into <HI>Egypt,</HI> caused him to fit

How many signes be there in Heaven and Earth, of the unity of God? yet the people believe not therein, and most of them adore Idols; assuredly God shall punish them at an unexpected houre, and in a time which they know not. Say unto them, Behold the right way, I call to the way of Salvation and Light, such as follow me. I return thanks to God, for that I am not in the number of unbelievers. We sent aforetime none but men to instruct the people, will not men consider what hath been the end of the wicked that were before them? Paradise is for them that are righteous; will yee not be converted? They caused the Prophets to lose all hopes of their Conversion, and believed them to be lyars; but we protected them, and delivered from their malice such as seemed good to us. nothing shall exempt the wic∣ked from the punishment of their pains; they shall serve for example to men of spirit. The <HI>Alcoran</HI> containeth no blasphemies, it confirmeth the ancient Scriptures, and reacheth True-believers the way of Salvation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. The Chapter of Thunder,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Gelal∣din <HI>and</HI> Bedaoi.</NOTE> containing fourty three Verses, writ¦ten <HI>at</HI> Mecca.</HEAD>
<P>IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull; I am the most wise and mercifull God. These precepts are the precepts of the Book sent to thee from the Lord; it is a thing most true, but few men incline to believe it. It is sent from God, who raised Heaven without a prop, and with a column, that appeareth, and sitteth on his throne, disposing all things. He causeth the Sunne and Moon to move, until the day appointed; he disposeth all things at his will, and manifesteth to men the signes of his omni∣potency. Peradventure you will believe in the Resurre∣ction of the flesh. He it is that hath extendeth the Earth, raised the Mountains, caused the Rivers to flow, who cre∣ated of all sorts of Fruits, the Male and Female, and co∣vereth the day with the obscurity of the night. These things are signes of his unity to such as consider them. He hath created many fields of divers sorts, and Gardens filled with Grapes, and many different Fruits; he created Date∣troes, thick as Groves, and Forrests, and others that are scattered through the fields; some are moystened with wa∣ters, and others have a more pleasing taste. These things are signes of his unity to such as consider them. Thou art amazed at the lies of Infidels, be astonished at their dis∣courses; when they deny the Resurrection, and say, What, shall God yet once again create us of the dust of the Earth? when we shall be earth, shall we be a new people? They are impious, they shall have yoaks upon their necks, and shall remain eternally in the fire of Hell; they pre∣cipitate themselves into eternall pains, and contemn the mercy of God, so did their predecessors; but God is gra∣cious to such as convert. Chastise severely the obstinate In∣fidels. They have said, We will not believe in the Pro∣phet, unless we see some miracle to appear. Say unto them, I am not sent but to preach the word of God. He hath sent persons to every Nation, to teach them the right way; nothing is hid from him in the world; he knoweth what
<PB N="155" REF="88"/>
women bear in their womb; he knoweth the time and pe∣riod of every thing, the present, past, and future; hee is great and omnipotent. He understandeth what you keep secret, and what ye make manifest; hee knoweth where they be who cove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> themselves with the obscurity of night, and them that travell in the clearness of day; every one hath his guardian by his commandement, who observeth what he doth, and depriveth none of grace, that hath not offended his divine Majesty, and none can hinder him to punish whom it seemeth good to him. He it is, who giveth you to see the lightning which terrifieth men, and nou∣risheth his Creatures by the rain which he causeth to fall; he created the clouds charged with moysture, causeth thun∣der to make a noise, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth the Thunder-bolt, and stri∣keth whom it pleaseth him; the Angels tremble in his presence, yet do the wicked dispute his omnipotency. He it is who ought to be implored; the prayers of them who implore another God are ineffectuall, they are like to such as are very thirsty, and stretch forth the hand towards a Fountain, to which they cannot reach; the prayers of the wicked are impiety: Whatsoever is in Heaven, and in the Earth, the shadow of the morning▪ the obscurity of the evening humble themselves before God, through force or affection. Say unto them, Who is the Lord of Heaven and Earth, but God? who, except God shall protect you? your Idols can neither benefit, nor hurt you: Is the blind like unto him that seeth cleerly? is darkness like unto light? shall they adore the Creatures in stead of the Creator? God hath created all things, and is omnipotent, he causeth rain to descend from Heaven, and Rivers co∣vered with Foam, to flow in the Valleys. The Gold, the Silver, and Mettals which ye melt to adorn and enrich your selves, are like unto froth. Thus doth God teach what is profitable and what unprofitable; froth suddenly vanisheth, and is of no utility to men: So falshood va∣nisheth before truth. Thus doth God speak through a pa∣rable, to them that obey him, and giveth them Paradise. All the riches of the Earth, and as much again, cannot ransom the Infidels, they shall be eternally tormented in
<PB N="156" REF="89"/>
the fire of Hell. Who knoweth, that the truth contained in this Book, was not sent to thee from God? He that doubt∣eth is blind; men of Spirit do not doubt. They who satis∣fie what they promise to God, who transgress not his Com∣mandements, who have his fear before their eyes, who ap∣prehend the day of Judgement, who are patient in their af∣flictions for love of his divine Majesty, who make their prayers at the time appointed, who give alms privately and publikely, and blot out their offendes with good works▪ shall be blessed. They shall enter into the Garden of <HI>Eden</HI> with their father, their wives, and families; the Angels shall visit them; shall salute them, and say, Behold the re∣compence of your perseverance, behold eternall grace. Such as shall swarve from their promise, and disobey the Commandements of God, and pollute the Earth, shall be accursed of God, and severely chastised; he giveth, and deprived of wealth, as seemeth good to him. The unbelie∣vers rejoyce in the riches of the earth; but those riches are of little value, if they consider them of the other world. They say, If <HI>Mahomet</HI> doth not make some miracle to ap∣pear from God, we will not believe him. Say unto them, God guideth, and misleadeth whom it pleaseth him; he confirmeth the hearts of them that have faith in his Law; the Remembrance of God confirmeth the hearts of True-believers: Such as shall do good works, shall be hap∣py. We have sent thee, as we did send other Prophets, to them that preceded thee. Teach the people what we have inspired into thee: When they, shall disobey thee, say un∣to them, God is my Lord, there is but one God alone, I am wholly resigned to his divine wil; my refuge is in his good∣ness. If the <HI>Alcoran</HI> should make Mountains to go, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould it cause the Earth to open, and the dead to arise, all would proceed from God. True-believers ought not to dispair of any thing, God shall guide all the world into the right way when it shall please him; and unbelievers shall not escape the punishment of their crimes. Thou shalt dwell with them until the word of God be f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lfilled: He swarveth not from what he promiseth; they derided the Prophets that came before thee, I prolonged the time of their pu∣nishment,
<PB N="157" REF="89"/>
and in the end rigorously chastised them; and with what affl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons? Doth not God behold the actions of every man? They have said, God hath companions, to whom they have given names after their fancy; will you instruct God in any thing? The wicked take delight in their wickedness, and are gone astray from the right way. He whom God shall mislead, shall find none to guide him, he shall be affl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted in this world, and yet more in the other. None shall be able to save him but God; Paradise is promised to them that have his fear before their eyes; they shall enjoy eternally all manner of content, such is the end of the righteous; and Hell is prepared for Infi∣dels. They, to whom we have given the knowledge of Scriptures, rejoyce in the doctrine which we have sent thee; there be that abjure one part; say unto them, I re∣commend unto you only the worship of one sole God, who is the assured refuge of the righteous. We have sent the <HI>Al∣coran</HI> in the <HI>Arabique</HI> tongue, to the end the <HI>Arabians</HI> may comprehend it: If thou dost follow the will of unbelie∣vers, having had the knowledge of the unity of God, who shall be able to save or protect thee? We sent Prophets be∣fore thee, commanded them to marry, &amp; they had children. Prophets cannot performe miracles w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thout the permissi∣on of God, and the end of every thing is written in his Book; he blo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eth out, and leaveth permanent what seemeth good to him, he cannot alter. I perceive that some of the wicked have a designe to murther thee; thou art obliged only to preach to them, I will keep an accompt of their sins to punish them, See they not that their Countries and possessions diminisheth daily through thy conquests?

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. The Chapter of <HI>Abraham,</HI> containing fifty verses, written at Mecca.</HEAD>
<P>IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull; I am the mercifull God. That Book▪ We have sent it to thee to bring the people out of darkness, to guide them to the light, and the way of thy Lord, alwayes victorious and glo∣rious; Whatsoever is in Heaven, and in Earth, is Gods; misery is upon unbelievers, they shall undergoe at the end of the world exceeding great torments. They who preferre the wealth of this world to that of Heaven, who goe astray from the way of the Law, and would pervert it, are in a great error, far from truth; The Prophets spake the lan∣guage of them to whom they were sent to instruct them, God guideth and misleadeth whom to him seemeth good, he is omnipotent and prudent. We sent <HI>Moses</HI> with prodi∣gies, to bring the children of Israel out of darkness, and to conduct them to light, he taught them the Commande∣ments of the Law, to serve for instruction to such as shall persevere to do well, and shall not be ingratefull for the favours they have received. <HI>Moses</HI> spake to his people, and said, remember the grace of God towards you, he delive∣red you from the men of <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> who caused you to suffer great afflictions, who murthered your Children, abused your wives, and layed upon you great evills (sent from God, because of your sins.) The Lord hath said, if ye be not ingratefull, I will augment my graces upon you; if ye be impious, you shall be afflicted. <HI>Moses</HI> said to his people; if you and all men be impious, know that God will be al∣wayes glorious, and hath no need of you. Know ye not what befell (before you) the people of <HI>Noah, Aad, Temod,</HI> and their posterity, that none had knowledge of but God; because of their great number? He sent them his Com∣mandements by his Prophets, they bit their fingers for an∣ger, and said unto them, we renounce, and condemne your Doctrine: The Prophets said unto them, is there any doubt in the beliefe of the unity of God, Creator of Hea∣ven,
<PB N="159" REF="90"/>
and Earth? he calleth you to remit your sinnes, and deferreth your punishment unill the day appointed: They answered, ye are men like unto us, will you hinder us to adore the Gods of our fathers? Produce argu∣ments of strength sufficient to prove what you preach; the Prophet replyed, Wee are men as you are, but God giveth his grace to whom seemeth good to him; we are come to you through his permission, the True-believers ought to trust in him; wherefore should wee not be re∣signed to the will of God, who hath guided us in the right way? we will continue in wel-doing, the righ∣teous trust in his divine Majesty. Then said the Infi∣dels unto them, we will banish you from our Country, if you be not of our Religion; but God inspired into them, that the Infidels should perish, and that they should inhabit the Land after them; that he would pro∣tect such as should have his fear before their eyes, and fear the pains that are prepared for the wicked. The Pro∣phets were protected of God, and the obstinate wicked were destroyed: they shall be precipitated into Hell, and drink of water full of corruption, urine and blood, death shal appear on all sides before their eyes, before they have swallowed that drink; they shall not dye in that misery, they shall suffer yet greater pains. The good works which the wicked have done, are like to dust carryed away by an impetuous winde, they shall be unprofitable to them, and they shall be extirpated, because they depart from the truth: See they not that God hath created Heaven and Earth? that he can destroy them, and create in their place a new people, if it seem good to him? This is not difficult to God, all things are known to him. The more impotent of them that have followed the wicked, shall say at the day of Judgement, we obeyed you, wil you this day deli∣ver us from the punishment of God? They shall answer, had God guided us in the right way, we had conducted you thither, we are alike miserable with you, we cry and lament in our misery, but finde neither refuge nor prote∣ction. The Devill shall say unto them, what God hath pro∣mised to you is infallible, I foretold it to you, I caused you
<PB N="160" REF="91"/>
to transgresse his Commandements through my tentati∣ons, I had none other power over you, but to tempt you, you did me no harm, when ye hearkened to me, you drew mischief on your selves, I am not your Tutor, neither are you mine, I was impious, when heretofore I suffered you to adore me; Hell is prepared for you, and for all unbe∣lievers, there shall they endure great torments, and the righteous shall enter into Paradise, wherein flow many rivers, where they shall dwell eternally, with all manner of blessednesse and content; Seest thou not how God speaketh by a parable? A good word is like to a good tree that hath taken root in the Earth, and hath raised its branches to heaven, and produceth its fruit in due time, through the permission of his divine Majesty; hee teach∣eth the people his parables, perhaps they will be mindfull: An evill word is like to a bad tree, that hath been torne from the Earth, there is nothing to sustain it, and it is without root, or fruit: God fortifieth the True-believers through his word in this world, and in the other, and causeth the unjust to erre, he doth what to him seemeth good: Seest thou not them that have changed his grace into impiety, and have made such as have followed them to dwell in the house of perdition? They shall abide e∣ternally in the fire of Hell. They say, that God hath a companion equall to him, and erre from the way of his Law, Say unto them, ye shall have wealth in this world, but Hell is your Rendezvous. Say to the True-believers, who make their prayers at the time appointed, and give aimes in private, or in publike, that the day shall come wherein they shall neither buy nor sell, and where every one shall be recompenced for his works. Say unto them, God hath created the Earth, and the Heavens, he maketh the rain to descend from Heaven, which causeth to spring forth all sorts of fruits to enrich you, he created the ship, that through his permission saileth on the Sea, hee crea∣ted the Rivers, the Sunne and the Moone, which move continually, hee created the day and the night, and bestoweth on you whatsoever yee desire, his favours towards you can neither be numbred, nor recounted,
<PB N="161" REF="91"/>
nevertheless the Inhabitants of <HI>Mecca</HI> are alwayes impi∣ous and wicked; <HI>Abraham</HI> said, Lord protect this City, and make it to be the refuge of the world; Keep me and my Children from the worship of Idols, they have se∣duced a part of the people; he that shall follow me, and professe thy unity, shall be mine; if any one disobey me, thou art gracious and mercifull: Lord, one part of my Lineage inhabiteth <HI>Mecca,</HI> in a place unfruitfull, give them the grace to persevere in thy service, incline the hearts of men to affect them, enrich them with the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uits of the Earth, peradventure they will thanke thee; thou knowest whatsoever is in the world, I know it not; no∣thing that is in Heaven, or in Earth is hid from thee; praysed be God, who hath given me <HI>Ismael</HI> and <HI>Isaac</HI> in mine old age, he heareth prayers when it pleaseth him; Lord, give me and my posterity the grace to persevere in well-doing, hear my prayers, pardon me, and pardon my father, and all True-believers at the day of Judgement. Think not that God is ignorant of the actions of Infi∣dels, he deferreth the punishment of their crimes untill the day that all men shall have their eyes opened: that day shall they behold their sins before their eyes, and their hearts shall be full of desolation; If thou preachest to the people the day of Judgement, hath God (will the wicked say) preserved us to this present time, to do what thou dost appoint us? Say unto them, have ye not sworn heretofore, that there is no resurrection? Ye have dwelt with the unjust, ye have seen how they have been chasti∣sed, and how we have spoken to you in parables. Cer∣tainly they conspire, but God knoweth their conspiracy, their policie is to tempt the Prophet, to see if he will make the Mountains to move. Think not that God will violate what hee hath promised to the Prophets, hee is omnipotent, and avengefull. Consider the day where∣in the Earth and Heavens shall change their face, and all people shall rise again; that day shall one sole God omnipotent, command men to come out of their Monu∣ments; Thou shalt that day see the wicked bound in their chaines, their garments shall be full of pitch,

and guitran, their faces shall be covered with fire, that day shall he recompense and chastise every one according to his works, he is exact to keep account; This Book was sent to instruct the people, and teach them that there is but one God; the wise will remember.</P>

These things are arguments of his Unity, to such as consider them; he created the night, the day, the Sun, the Moone, and the Stars, that move at his pleasure, these things are signs of his Omnipotency to them that are wise; He created whatsoever is on Earth of divers colours kind, and species; he created the sea, which affordeth you fish, pearles, and other precious stones to adorne you; thou seest how the ships saile upon the waters, and divide the waves for the advantage of commerce, peradventure you will give God thanks for his favours. He raised the mountaines to make firm the Earth, and to hinder it to move, he created the rivers, and established way<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to guide you; he made the Stars to conduct you by night upon the sea, and the mountains to direct you in your way by day▪ who but he could have creat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d what he hath made? will you never consider it? It is not in your power to keep account of his mercies, he is altogether gracious and mercifull, and knoweth the secret of your souls: the Idolls that ye adore can create nothing, but are things dead, without motion, and know not in what time the world shall rise again; your God is one sole God; such as believe not the end of the world, such as deny his U∣nity, and boast of their false beliefe, are abhorred of his divine Majesty; when they are interrogated concerning what God hath inspired into <HI>Mahomet</HI>; they answered, that he preacheth Fables of antiquity, but they shall bear their burthen at the day of Judgement, who have sedu∣ced them from the right way, and have not known it. They that were before them were deceivers, God overthrew their habitations, the ruines fell upon them, and he cha∣stised them; when they least thought of it; he sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll make them ashamed at the day of Judgement, and shall demand of them, where be the Idols for which they disputed a∣gainst
<PB N="167" REF="94"/>
true-believers? Such as have knowledge of Gods Commandements, assure that shame shall be upon the foreheads of Infidels, and that the Angels shall cause them to die, because of the enormity of their sins; They will say at the houre of death, that they believe in God, and are penitent for their faults, God knoweth what they have done; he shall command them to enter into hell, where is the abode of the proud: He shall command them who have his feare before their eyes to enter the house of E∣ternity, and the gardens <HI>Eden,</HI> wherein flow many ri∣vers, there shall they dwell eternally with the height of their desire. Shall the wicked continue in their sin, untill the Angels cause them to die, or untill the day of Judge∣ment? Thus did their predecessors. God was not unjust towards them, they drew mischief on themselves through their iniquity; they were chastised and felt the punish∣ment which they had despised; they have said, had it so pleased God, our fathers and we had adored him alone; so spake their predecessors. The Prophets are not obli∣ged, but to preach and instruct the people. We sent a Prophet to every Nation, to instruct it, and to command the worship of one sole God, and to quit the adoration of <HI>Tagot,</HI> and of Idols; God guided some into the right way, and others were seduced; consider what is the end of the wicked; if thou indeavourest to put them into the right path, thou shalt lose thy time, God guideth not them that desire to erre, they shall be deprived of protection at the day of Judgement; they have sworne by their faith, that God will not make the dead to rise againe, but he shall cause them to rise againe, to chastise them according to his promises; but the greatest part of men doe not know it, did they know it, they would acknowledge their errors, and the impious would acknowledge their blas∣phemies. When we willed any thing, we said, be thou, and it was! They that depart from the wicked for the love of their Lord, and shall convert themselves, shall be rewarded in this world, and yet more in the other, had they knowledge to understand it. Such as patiently en∣dure the injuries of unbelievers, and trust in their Lord
<PB N="168" REF="95"/>
shall be recompensed when they least think of it. We here∣tofore sent but men to preach our Law; ask of them that have knowledge of the written Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Jewes and Chri∣stians.</NOTE> if it be not true? We have sent to them the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> to the end thou maist in∣struct men in our Commandements, peradventure they will consider it. The earth shall produce nothing to them, that shall conspire against the Prophet, they shall be cha∣stised when they least think of it; God shall afflict them in their commerce, they shall not escape his punishment, and their substance shall diminish by little and little be∣fore their eyes; God is gracious and mercifull to them only that honour him: See they not the shadow of that which God hath created, sometimes at the right hand, sometimes at the left, to adore his divine Majesty, they certainly are contemptible; whatsoever is on the earth, and in the heavens, beast, and Angels, worship God with humility, feare their Lord, and obey his Commande∣ments. God hath commanded them to worship and to feare one God, alone, to whom obedience is due, eternal∣ly; whom will ye feare but God? who but God shall pro∣tect you? when evill befalleth you, you have recourse to his divine goodnesse; being delivered, some of you give him thanks, and yet believe not in his Law: You seek on∣ly the riches of the earth, but you shall see what shall be your end, they say that their wealth proceedeth from their Idols: by God! an account of their blasphemies shall be required of them; they affirme that God hath daugh∣ters; assuredly they deceive themselves, and are not well satisfied, when it is said to them, that a daughter is born to them; they fly such as declare to them the punishment of their sins, God shall leave them in igmony, and they shall be contemned as the earth which they trample un∣der their feet; because they believe not in the day of Judgement, misery shall perpetually pursue them; God shall command for ever, and be eternally powerfull and victorious. Should God chastise men when they offend, he should leave no living creature upon the earth, he defer∣reth their punishment untill the time appointed, they can neither advance nor retard it; they affirm God to have that
<PB N="169" REF="95"/>
which themselves are not satisfied to have; they lye, when they say that paradise is for them, doubtlesse they are er∣roneous, and shall be precipitated into the fire of hell. By God! we have sent heretofore Prophets to the people, the devill seduced men, and was master of the wicked in this world, but in the other they shall rescent great tor∣ments: We have sent thee the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> to cleare to men the doubts touching Religion, and to guide true belie∣vers into the right way. God sendeth raine from heaven to refresh the earth, this is an evident signe of his omni∣potency, to them that heare his word; ye have yet a to∣ken of his omnipotency in the beasts that give you milk, to nourish you, and another marke in the fruits of the earth, in the fruits of Date trees, and the Vines, from which you extract wine, and receive profit. These things are signes of his omnipotency, to such as comprehend them. The Lord inspired the Bee to dwell in the fields, to lodge in trees, in Hives, and to eat of all sorts of fruits, it produceth honey of divers colours, that serveth for a remedy to the diseases of men; these things are signes of Gods omnipotency to them that consider them. God hath created you, and shall cause you to dye; There be per∣sons among you that shall be full of ignominy in their life, to the end they may understand that God is omni∣potent, conferreth benefits on some more then on others. Slaves have no part in the faculties of their Masters, neither are they associate with them, neverthelesse they associate to God another God equall to him, and blas∣pheme against his grace.) God hath created you men, and women, hath given you Children, and Children to your Children, he hath enriched you with the riches of the earth; Will you after this grace believe in your Idols, which are things inanimate, vaine, and un∣profitable? Will yee bee ingratefull for the benefits of God? Will yee Worship what can neither benefit not hurt you? Believe not that there is another God companion and associate with God; Hee know∣eth what yee know not, hee teacheth you a Parable: A Slave that is poore cannot give Almes, and
<PB N="170" REF="96"/>
he who is rich giveth almes secretly and publiquely, as he seeth good; are they both alike? Ought they to be put in paralell? Praise be to God: Certainly, the greatest part of men know not his graces, he teacheth you a para∣ble: Behold! two men, the one was borne deaf, and dumb, and given in charge to his Guardian, he knoweth not how to imploy him, he is capable neither of doing, nor spea∣king well, is he like to him that speaketh, that understan∣deth, teacheth men Justice, and followeth the right way? Whatsoever is in Heaven, or on Earth appertaineth to God, when he commandeth any thing, it is performed in the twinkling of an eye, yea sooner, he is omnipotent: He it is that causeth you to come out of the wombe of your mother, that giveth you hearing, sight, and sense, per∣haps ye will return him thanks; See ye not the birds that flye in the Aire; who sustaineth them but God? It is an evident signe of his omnipotency for the True-believers, he hath given you houses to inhabit, and the skins and furres of beasts to cover you, he hath given you their haire, and wooll, to furnish your houses, and enrich you; he created trees and clouds to overshadow you, made the Mountaines and Caves to cover you from rain, created garments to defend you from the heat of the Sun, and the rigour of cold, he hath accomplished his grace upon you, peradventure you will resigne your selves to the will of his divine Majesty, and professe his Unity. If the unbe∣lievers depart from the way of the Law, thou art obliged only to preach to them intelligibly; they know the grace of God, and contemne it, for that the greatest part of them are impious; preach unto them the day, wherein I will raise againe all the Nations of the world, and the Prophets and Apostles who have preached to them my Commandements, there shall be no excuse for Infidels, neither shall they find protection, or relaxation of their miseries: When they shall behold their Idols, they shall confesse that they were mislead, they shall understand the unity of thy Lord, and that their Idols are not a∣ble to intercede for them. God hath added to the punishment of Infidels, hath sent them evill upon
<PB N="171" REF="96"/>
evill, because they hinder the world to follow his Law: Preach unto them the day, wherein I will cause to rise a∣gain all the Nations of the world, with the Prophet who preached to them, to be witness of their actions; I will be witness against them of thy Nation; I have sent thee the Book that unfoldeth the mysteries of my Law, to guid the people into the right way, and to declare the joyes of paradise to such as professe my unity. God com∣mandeth you to do only that which is reasonable, he com∣mandeth you to give almes, and do good to your parents, he forbiddeth whordom, disobedience, and injustice, en∣joyneth you to do good, perhaps you will consider it. Per∣form what ye have promised to God, break not promised faith, ye call God to be witness of your promises, hee knoweth all your actions. Do not like the woman who spun a thred, foulded it, and afterwards entangled it and spoyled it, believe not that there is deceit and error in your Law; If the unbelievers be more in numbers then you, God permitteth it, to prove you; he shall clear to you at the day of Judgement the doubts that be among you; had it so pleased him, you all had observed one and the same Law; he guideth, misleadeth whom it pleaseth him, and will exactly require of you an accompt of your actions. Believe not that there is deceipt in your Law, take heed of stumbling; having once confirmed your steps, ye shall be severely chastised, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f ye seduce the people from the right way; do not violate what ye have promised to God, for any price, his grace is of more advantage to you then the wealth of the earth, had ye knowledge to understand it; your wealth is perishable, and the riches of heaven are eternall; he shall recompence them that persevere in wel-doing, and whosoever shall doe good works, shall be blessed in this world, and in the other. When thou shalt read the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> implore God to deli∣ver thee from the malice of the Divell, abominable to all the Creatures, he hath no power over them that trust in his divine Majestie, his power extendeth over such as go astray, who obey not him, and adore many Gods. When we alter any precepts (God well knoweth what he orda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣neth),

they say thou art a lyar, but the greatest part of them are ignorant; Say unto them, that assuredly the Holy Ghost hath taught it from thy Lord, to confirme believers in their faith, and to guide into the right way them that professe his unity, and to anounce to them the joyes of Paradise. I know, that they will say that a man hath taught him the <HI>Alcoran.</HI> He whom they presume to have taught him, is a Persian by Nation, and speaketh the Language of the Persians, and the <HI>Alcoran</HI> is in the <HI>Arabique</HI> tongue, full of instruction and eloquence. They who will not believe in God, shall suffer great torments; such as renounce his Commandements, blaspheme a∣gainst his divine Majesty; those that reject his Law, after having professed it, shall feel the effect of his wrath, and be punished for preferring the wealth of the earth to the riches of Heaven; God guideth not unbelievers. They in whose hearts he hath imprinted disobedience, those whom he hath deprived of hearing, and sight, are ignorant, they doubtlesse shall be at the end of the world in the number of the damned; he is mercifull to them that convert, and repent to have mislead the people from the right way and persevere in obedience to his Com∣mandements. Be thou mindfull of the day, wherein man shall dispute against himself, and every one shall be re∣warded according to his works without injustice. God teacheth you a Parable; Behold a free and Priviledged City, on the which God poureth his graces on all sides with abundance, and is ingratefull for his benefits; but he sent upon it misery, famine, and feare, because of its ingratitude. God hath sent to the Inhabitants thereof a Prophet of their Nation, they have slandered him, and were chastised, because of their sinne. Eate of what God hath given you, and give him thanks for his grace; if it be he whom ye worship, he forbiddeth you to eat of Car∣rion, of Bloud, and Swines-flesh, and whatsoever is not slaine in pronouncing the name of God; he will be gra∣cious and mercifull to them who shall eat through ne∣cessity, without designe to offend him. Lye not, in saying, Behold that which is permitted to be eaten! blaspheme
<PB N="173" REF="97"/>
not against God; such as blaspheme against him, shall not prosper in this world, and in the ot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er shall suffer grievous torments. We did heretofore prohibit the Jews to eat of what we have recounted to thee, we did to them no injustice, they drew mischief on themselves through their sinne; thy Lord is gracious and mercifull to them that ignorantly offend him, who convert, and doe good works. <HI>Abraham</HI> was obedient to God, and professed his unity, he adored not Idols, and gave thanks to God for his mercies; God elected, and guided him into the right way, he gave him wealth in this world, and placed him in the other, in the number of the blessed. We have in∣spired thee to follow the Law of <HI>Abraham,</HI> he professed the unity of God, and adored not Idols, he established the Sabbath among the Jews, of which they dispute; God shall judge their d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fference at the day of Judgement. Call the people to the Law of God with prudence, and prea∣chings, and dispute against them with good arguments, God knoweth them that depart from the right way; if they evilly intreat you, intreat them as they shall intreat you; if ye be patient, patience is advantagious to them that take it willingly, have patience for the love of God, and afflict not your selves with the deportments and ma∣lice of the wicked, God is with the righteous, who have his feare before their eyes.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="174" REF="98"/>IN the Name of God, gracious and mercifull. Praise be to him, that caused his servant to goe in one night from the Temple of <HI>Mecca,</HI> to the Temple of <HI>Jerusalem</HI>; wee have blessed that Temple, and whatsoever is about it, in token of our omnipotency. We gave to <HI>Moses</HI> the Old Te∣stament, to instruct the Children of Israel, and to deterr them from the worship of any other God, but of me; to forbid them to adore the lineage of <HI>Noah,</HI> or the lineage of them that we preserved in his Ark.<NOTE PLACE="marg">To quit their saith, and return to it of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en.</NOTE> <HI>Noah</HI> is my crea∣ture, and my servant, acknowledging my benefits; wee prohibited in Scripture the children of <HI>Israel,</HI> to defile twice the Earth, left they kindled too great a fire; when that befell you,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Kitab el tenoir.</HI></NOTE> we stirred up our servants against you, and they entered by force into the midst of your houses; this was as soon executed as promised. In the end, we gave you advantage over your enemies; we gave you wealth, and children to succor you, and ye were more numerous then the Infidels; the good and the evill that you shall doe, shall be for your souls. We stirred up the wicked a∣gainst you, because of your sins, to afflict you through the murther, and bondage of your persons; and they destroy∣ed the Temple of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> as they had ruined it the first time. Your Lord shall pardon you, if you convert, we have established Hell for a perpetuall prison of Infidels. The <HI>Alcoran</HI> guideth the righteous into the right way, it declareth to them a great reward, preacheth to the wic∣ked the torments of Hell; and exhorteth men to wel∣doing, although they are inclining to evill, and prompt to sin. We created the day and the night, they are two signes of our omnipotency: we caused the night to passe away, and the day to appeare for labor; and to the end ye might know number of ages, of months, and of yeares: wee explained our mysteries without obscuri∣ty, and have enjoyned every one to beare the bur∣den of his iniquities at the day of judgement; that day will we make men to see the accompt of their sins, they shall be recompen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed and chastised accor∣ding to the good and evill that they shall have committed, and none shall beare burden of his neigh∣bor:
<PB N="175" REF="98"/>
we sent to the people Prophets and Apostles to preach to them our Commandements, before they were chasti∣sed, before the destruction of a City: we advert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed the principall inhabitants thereof; when they disobeyed us, we chastised them according to our word, and destroyed them. How many Cities have we ruined since <HI>Noahs</HI> flood? The sins of the people and knowne to their Lord; he gi∣veth the riches of this world to them that desire them, to cause them to fall head-long into Hell, where they shall repent of their iniquities, and be deprived of mercy. He who shall labor to acquire the riches of Heaven, shall be protected of thy Lord in this world, and enriched with the Treasures of Heaven in the other. Consider, how we prefer our Creatures one to another▪ the reward of Hea∣ven is much greater then that of the Earth. Believe not that there be two Gods, otherwise you shall repent of it, and be deprived of protection at the day of judgement. Thy Lord hath ordained to worship him alone, and to honour your father and mother, especially in their old age, and say nothing to them that may afflict them, nei∣ther vex them; speak to them with respect, doe not con∣temne them, pray to God to compassionate them, as they pittied, when they brought you up in your infancy. God knoweth whatsoever is in your souls; he will be mercifull to you, if ye obey him. Give to your parents what ap∣pertaineth to them, doe good to the poore, and to pil∣grims, be not prodigall, the prodigall are brethren of the Devill, ingratefull for the favors of their Lord. Con∣temne not the poore, if ye desire to obtain the mercy of God, speak to them with mildnesse, and endeavour to content them; doe not entirely shut your hands, neither altogether extend them; if yee doe otherwise, yee shall offend. Thy Lord giveth, and taketh away his graces, as seemeth good to him; hee knoweth his people, and understandeth all their actions. Slay not your children for feare of necessity, I will give whatso∣ever shall be necessary for them; the murther of chil∣dren is an exceeding great sin, flie whoredom, it is a thing uncleane, kill no man without reason; we have com∣manded
<PB N="176" REF="99"/>
to pursue him that shal have slain his neighbour, but let not the heir sin maliciously, prosecuting the inno∣cent for the guilty. The innocent is in Gods protecti∣on: take not the goods of Orphans, and be carefull of them, untill they be in yeers of discretion; satifie your promises, an accompt shall be required of you; measure with good measure, and weigh with just weights. Busie your selves not with that which you ought not to know. There shall be required of you an accompt of the sins ye have committed, in seeing, hearing, and thinking. Be not proud, ye shall never be so long as the Earth, neither so high as the Mountains; such sins are exceeding great before thy Lord: It is one part of what he hath inspired into thee, to preach to his people: Say not, there be two Gods, left thou be confined to the fire of Hell. Your Lord hath elected you, with all those men and women that o∣bey his Commandements, for his sons and daughters, as the Angels; yet say not that God hath children. We made mention in the <HI>Alcoran</HI> of whatsoever is necessary to be preached to the people; say unto them, If there be a God with God, as ye affirme, invok him that hath his Throne in Heaven; praised be God, he hath no Companion, he is most high and great. The seven Heavens praise him, and all that is in Earth glorifie him, but ye comprehend it not, he is gracious and mercifull, We will separate thee from the wicked; we will harden their hearts, and stop their ears. When thou shalt read the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and say, There is but one God, they will turne the back, and deride thee, I know what they desire to heare; they would have the people to hearken to the words of the unjust, who say, That thou art a Sorcerer, and a Magician; con∣sider to whom they compare thee; they certainly are in error, and are not able to find the right way. What! we are (say they) bones and flesh, shall we rise againe, and become new Creatures? who shall cause us to rise again? Say unto them, Although ye be stone, iron, bones, and flesh, he who first created you, shall raise you a∣gaine. They shall shake the head at thee, and ask of thee. In what time they shall rise againe? say unto them, Per∣adventure
<PB N="177" REF="99"/>
it shall be suddenly. When ye shall be called out of the graves by the Commandement of God, ye will believe that ye have remained but very little time in the world; then shall the Infidels confesse, that the Devill hath deceived them, and that he is their open enemy. Your Lord knoweth you all, he will pardon, or chastise you, as seemeth good to him: We have not sent thee to be their guardian; thy Lord knoweth whatsoever is in Heaven and in Earth. Certainly, we gave graces to some Pro∣phets, which we gave not to others; and we gave the Psalter to <HI>David</HI>; Say unto the Infidels, invoke the Idols which you adore, and see if they are of power to deliver you from affliction. They that implore God, desire to be nigh unto him; who are they that shall neerest approach his divine Majesty they who hope in his mercy, or such as feare his punishment? Certainly his punishment ought most to be feared. We will destroy all the Cities of the world before the day of Judgement, and chastise the wic∣ked with rigorous torments; this is written upon the Ta∣bles kept in heaven; nothing hath hindred us to manifest the miracles which the inhabitants of <HI>Mecca</HI> desire to see, but the contempt shewed by their predecessors. <HI>Tenod</HI> saw the miracles of the Camell, and contemned it; I will no more shew miracles, but to make the people to ap∣prehend the torments of hell. Remember thou, that we have said to thee, that thy Lord knoweth all that the world doth; that which we gave thee to see (in the voy∣age by night) is to prove the people as the cursed tree,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Gelal∣din.</HI></NOTE> which is spoken of in the <HI>Alcoran</HI>; there be persons that will believe it, others that will not believe; but I will trie them to augment their confusion: Remember thou, that we commanded the Angels to humble themselves before <HI>Adam,</HI> and that they did humble themselves, except the devill; who said, shall I adore him whom thou hast created of the earth? who is he whom thou hast preferred to me? Certainly, if thou tarry untill the day of Judgement, I will destroy his race, except that small number that shall be under thy protection. Thy Lord said unto him, get thee hence, hell shall be thy punishment, and
<PB N="178" REF="100"/>
the punishment of them that shall follow thee; deceive by thy speeches them whom thou shalt be able to deceive, seduce whom thou canst seduce with the wealth of the earth, cause them to exercise Usury, and commit the sin of whoredome; tell them, there is neither Resurrection nor Judgement; whatsoever thou shalt promise them shall be but vanity and falshood; thou shalt have no power over them that shall worship me, I will protect them a∣gainst thee. It is your Lord, who causeth the ship to tra∣vell upon the waters, for the advantage of traffique; when the tempest chargeth you, your Idols forsake you, he a∣lone is able to protect you, neverthelesse when he hath caused you to arrive at the Port, you deny his Unity, and follow your impiety; believe ye that he will another time make the sea calm to you? and that he will send you a favourable wind, if you doe not acknowledge him your protector; Believe ye to returne againe to the sea? He shall send you an impetuous wind, that shall overwhelme you, with your impietie, and ye shall find none to protect you against him. We have conferred on men many fa∣vours, we have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onducted them on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> earth, and sea, en∣riched with all sorts of riches, and gratified them above all creatures of the earth; preach to them the day where∣in I will assemble before me all the Nations of the world, with the Prophet that shall have preached to them. He to whom shall be given the Book of the Accompt of his works in his right hand, shall read his accompt entire∣ly, no injustice shall be done to him, and he shall be hap∣py. He that shall be blind in this world, shall be so in the other, and shall not see the right way. They would divert thee from performing what we have inspired into thee, to induce thee to blaspheme against me. If thou do it, thou shalt be of their friends; were it not for the strength that we have given thee, they would make thee to incline to their impiety, hadst thou done it, we had given thee to taste of great afflictions in this world, &amp; in the other; thou hadst found none to protect thee against us; it wanted not much, but they had affrighted thee at <HI>Medina,</HI> to cause thee to go out of it; had they driven thee thence, they had not conti∣nued
<PB N="179" REF="100"/>
there long after thee. We heretofore sent our Prophets to instruct the people in our Law, thou shall find there∣in nothing to change; make thy prayers when the Sun shall set, at the beginning, and at the end of the night, and at the dawning of day, the Angels shall be witnes∣ses of thine orisons; spend one part of the night in pray∣er, this shall be an augmentation of merit, thy Lord shall establish thee in the place of his glory: Say, Lord, into whatsoever place I goe, make me to enter, and goe forth with truth, give me thy protection; Say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Gelal∣din.</HI></NOTE> that truth is come, and that vanity is vanished; this Book shall heal the people of their error, it shall bring them into the way of mercy, and encrease the misery of unbelievers. We have exhorted men to abandon their impiety, they have not done it, and despaired when they were touched with affliction; Say unto them, each of us doth after his will, and God knoweth him that followeth the right way; they shall demand of thee concerning the Soul: Say unto them, the soul is an effect of God, he hath given you ve∣ry little knowledge; assuredly, had it so pleased him, he could have deprived you of the knowledge he hath given you, you shall find nothing that is able to protect you but his mercy? Say unto them, if the devils, and men were all assembled against me, they should not be able to com∣pose a Book like the <HI>Alcoran.</HI> We have taught in the <HI>Al∣coran</HI> whatsoever is necessary for the salvation of men, neverthelesse the greatest part of the people depart from the Truth, and say, we will not believe thee, unlesse thou cause fountains to spring out of the earth, and make in this place a garden, beautified with Date trees, and Vines, with rivers flowing in the midst, or unlesse we see, descend from heaven a part of the pains which thou preachest; we will not believe thee, unlesse God and the Angels come to thy assistance, unlesse thy house be of fine gold, and that we see the Book of Truth sent from heaven; we will not believe in thy Parchment, unlesse we see descend from heaven a Book which we may be able to read: Say unto them, praised be my Lord, am I any thing but a man sent from him? what hindreth men to believe,

since there hath been sent to them a Pilot to conduct them into the way of salvation? They say, that thou art a man, and not an Angel: Say unto them, should the Angels have inhabited the Earth, God would have sent an An∣gel to instruct them, it sufficeth that he is the witnesse of mine actions between you, and me, he knoweth and seeth all things; he whom God guideth, is well guided, and such as God shall cause to erre, shall find none to put them into the right way; he will assemble all of them at the day of Judgement, they shall be infamous, deaf, mute, and blind, and condemned to the flames of hell, because they are wicked, and have said through derision, that they are bones, and flesh, and that they shall rise a∣gaine as new creatures; see they not that God hath crea∣ted heaven, and earth? that he can create yet more, and hath established a destiny indubitable, and infallible? The unbelievers are exceedingly too blame: Say unto them, should you possesse all the treasures of the world, yet would ye feare to make expence for the service of God; man is too avaricious; we gave to <HI>Moses</HI> nine marks of our Omnipotency, known to the children of <HI>Israel; Pha∣roah</HI> told him that he was a Magician;<NOTE PLACE="marg">His hand, his staffe, the deluge, grashop∣pers, lice, frogs, blood, fear, and fa∣mine.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. The Chapter of the Cave, containing an hundred and ten Verses, written at <HI>Mecca.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. Praise be to God, who hath sent the <HI>Alcoran</HI> to his servant. There is no contradiction in this Book; it teacheth the right way; it preacheth to the wicked, that they shall suffer great torments, and proclaimeth to the righteous, that they shall enjoy an eternall felicity; it preacheth the tor∣ments of Hell, principally to such as affirm, That God hath a Son; they are ignorant, like to their predecessors; they are arrogant in their discourse, and utter nothing but blaspemies: Wilt thou destroy thy self in following their footsteps? If they believe not in the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> they shall one day have sorrow, and shall repent it. We adorned the Earth, with whatsoever is upon it, for the advantage of men. One part thereof is happy and plentifull; and the other unfruitfull, and desart. Do ye not believe that the sleepers that entred the Cave, and the Paper wherein their names were written, be our miracles? when those men entred the Cave, they said, Lord, give us thy mercy, and guide us into the right way: Then did we cause them to sleep for the space of some years, and awaked them, having continued some time in that Cave, to make it ap∣pear which of the two Religions was the most just. I will relate to thee their History with truth; they were young men, who had the fear of their Lord before their eyes;
<PB N="182" REF="102"/>
we strengthned them, and encreased their faith; when they were with the Infidels, they said, Our God is Lord of Hea∣ven and Earth, we will never worship but one God, other∣wise we shall separate our selves from the truth: This people have adored Idols without reason; who is more unjust then he, who blasphemeth against God? When they deserted the Infidels, they worshipped one God alone. Enter into the Cave, God shall make his mercy towards you to appear, and shall guide you through a path, smooth and pleasant. When the Sun arose, he cast his rayes on the right side of their Cave, and on the left, at his going down; they in the mean time were in the most spacious place of this Cave. This is one of Gods miracles; hee whom he guideth, is well guided; and whom he mislead∣eth, shall find none to give him succour, or to guide him. Believe ye that they should be awake? Assuredly they slept and turned themselves, sometimes to one side, sometimes to another: Consider how their Dog extended his feet be∣fore that old habitation of stone; if any one had entred towards them, he would have caused them to flie, and had affrighted them. In the end we awaked them, and they mutually enquired of each other in what place they were, and how long they had there continued; one of them re∣plyed, That they had been there a day or two; then they all said, God knoweth the time that we have abode here, send one of us to the City with money to buy bread and meat; let him not be fearfull, neither make himself known to any; if wee be known, they will murther, or constrain us to follow their Religion, in which we shall be eternally miserable. Thus did we stir up the people against them, to the end they might know that thy Lord is true; when he said, He will cause the dead to arise again, the Resur∣rection is indubitable; nevertheless unbelievers dispute among them, concerning the History of the Sleepers, and say, That they built a secret place to retire themselves, God knoweth the Truth. The True-believers believe that they made no building; the Infidels say they were five, and that their dog was the sixth, they speak by opinion; but the True-believers affirm them to be seven, and their
<PB N="183" REF="102"/>
dog to be the eighth. Say unto them, My Lord knoweth how many they were; few persons except God, know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir number: Doubt no more the History of the Slee∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers, the matter is averred and known; dispute no more with the Jews, and say not, I will do this to morrow, with∣out saying, If it please God. Call God to minde, after thou hast forgot him, and say, The Lord shall guide me, and teach me the History of the Sleepers,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Gelal∣din.</NOTE> who remained in the Cave three hundred years; there be who affirme they continued there nine hundred years. Say unto them, God knoweth the time of their abode there, he knoweth whatsoever is in Heaven, and Earth, he understandeth and seeth all things, he alone disposeth every thing, and hath no companion; Preach what thy Lord hath inspired into thee, his word admitteth of no alteration, there is no safer refuge then in him; dwell with those that invoke him morning and evening, and desire to see his face; depart not from their company, if thou desirest to have content of life in this world; obey not those whose heart we have hardned, and are unmindfull of us; follow not their impiety, whatsoever they do, is but offence and sin. Say unto them, the truth proceedeth from your Lord; who shall desire [it] shall be True-believers, and who shall not desire [it] shall be an Infidell, we have prepa∣red Hell to chastise the impious, and prisons wherein to detaine them. They shall implore succors against the melting pit, into which they shall be plunged, as into wa∣ters, it shall rost their faces, and shall be their drink; I will not frustrate of reward them that shall have done well, they shall enjoy the delights of the gardens of <HI>Eden,</HI> wherein flow many rivers, they shall have bracelets of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine Gold, they shall be cloathed with green, with Scar∣let, and shining colours, and shall sit on thrones, with an eternall felicity. Declare to them this parable; there were two men, I gave to the one of them gardens, where∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n was store of fruits, he in contempt told his compani∣on, that he was more wealthy and powerfull then he, and entred into his gardens, being an Infidell, and an Idola∣ter, and said, I doe not think these shall ever have an
<PB N="184" REF="103"/>
end, they shall endure a long time without withering: His companion said to him; If thou dost not ackowledge this to proceed from God, and if thou be ingratefull to∣wards him that created thee of dust, and made thee a man, thou shalt soon finde thy gardens ruined; this com∣meth from God my Lord, who hath no companion; all strength, and truth proceedeth from his divine Magesty; If I have lesse of substance then thou, God can give me fruits more faire then those of thy gardens, or send thun∣der that shall destroy them, he shall fill them with water of rain, that shall encompasse them, and hinder thee to approach [them.] In the morning this Infidell found his gardens destroyed to the very roots, he was extream∣ly perplexed, by reason of the expence he had made to plant them eavenly; and he said, would to God I had not adored Idols: He shall find none that is able to pro∣tect him at the day of Judgement, but God, all protecti∣on, and grace issueth from his divine bounty, and the end of the righteous shall be happy. Speak unto them this parable, the life of the world is like unto rain fallen from Heaven, that refreshed and revived the herbs of the Earth, and in the morning were drie as chaste, carried a∣way by the winde; God is omnipotent: Riches and chil∣dren are the ornaments of this life, but good works are e∣ternall, they are acceptable to God, and give us hope of his grace. Be thou mindfull of the day when the moun∣tains shall walk, and thou shalt see the Earth to be plain; that day we assemble the good and the wicked, and will not faile of my word to any person; that day shall the In∣fidels beseech the Lord to save them, he shall say unto them, you came unto us naked, as when we at first created you, and ye believed on Earth, that there was no resurre∣ction; Then shall he give to every one the Book, where∣in shall be written the accompt of their sinnes; Thou shalt see the wicked trembling with fear, saying, behold here our destruction! What is there in this Book? It containeth their veniall and mortall sinnes, and dete∣cteth their offences, they shall find the number of their crimes before their eyes: Thy Lord is unjust to none;
<PB N="185" REF="103"/>
Remember thou that we commanded the Angels to pro∣strate themselves before <HI>Adam,</HI> and that they humbled themselves, except the Devill, who was in the number of Angels, he disobeyed his Lord; neverthelesse <HI>Adam</HI> and his posterity have obeyed him, although he is their open enemy, and particularly of the Infidels. Consider ye not that God created Heaven and Earth, that he made you, and hath no need to be aided of you? Be thou mindfull of the day, when it shall be said to Idolaters, call upon your Idols that ye have worshipped, for remission of your sinnes; they shall implore them, but none shall hear their prayers, we have ruined them; the wicked shall behold the fire, into which they shall fall, and finde none to save them. We taught men in the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> many parables, yet do the wicked abound in questions and dispute too much; What hindreth men to believe, since there is come to them a guide, to conduct them into the right way? If they beg not pardon of God, what hapned to their prede∣cessors, and at <HI>Beder,</HI> shall befall them, they shall be vi∣sibly punished; I send Prophets only to anounce the joyes of Paradise, and to preach the torments of Hell; the unbelievers dispute vainly, to obscure the truth, they deride my Commandements, and the fire of Hell; who is more unjust then hee who knoweth the Commande∣ments of his Lord, and disobeyeth him, and forgetteth his past sinnes? We have hardned their hearts, they shall not understand the Scripture; we have stopped their eares, they shall heare nothing; if thou callest them to the right way, they shall not follow thee, thy Lord is gra∣cious and mercifull; should he chastise them after their demerits, he should forthwith destroy them, he tarrieth untill the time that he hath promised to punish them, and they shall finde none of power to protect them. Wee have destroyed Cities, when their Inhabi∣tants have offended, and we prefixed the day of their ruine. Remember thou that <HI>Moses</HI> said to his servant, I will travell incessantly, untill I see a place where two seas meet, although I travell an Age. When he came to that place, hee and his servant forgot their fish,
<PB N="186" REF="104"/>
he had taken his way through the Sea: Having continu∣ed their voyage some time, <HI>Moses</HI> was an hungry, and de∣manded somewhat to eat of his servant, who said to him, Sawest thou what hapned at the Rock▪ I have forgotten our fish, the Devill made me to forget it, he miraculous∣ly took his way through the Sea; that Rock is the place which we seek: they both returned on their stops, dis∣coursing together, untill they came to that Rock? where they found one of our servants, on whom we had confer∣red our graces, and inspired knowledge; <HI>Moses</HI> said unto him, permit me to follow thee, that thou maist teach me knowledge; and instruct me; He replyed, thou wilt not be able to abide patiently with me; how wilt thou pati∣ently endure to hear a thing which none in the world eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> knew? <HI>Moses</HI> said, thou shalt find me exceeding patient, and I will not disobey thee; He answered, if thou follow me, enquire nothing of me, and hear only what I shall say to thee. They went together, and they being in a boat, he brake a planck; <HI>Moses</HI> said to him, thou hast broken this vessell, to drown us, it is a strange thing; He answe∣red, Did not I tell thee, that thou wilt not be able pati∣ently to abide with me? <HI>Moses</HI> replied, excuse me, and afflict me not, I had forgotten what thou didst enjoyne me; They went on together untill they met with a child, whom he slew; <HI>Moses</HI> said to him, thou hast slain an in∣nocent, that hath not slain any one; thou hast done a thing without reason, and that ought not to be approved: He answered, did I not say, thou wilt not be able patient∣ly to abide with me? <HI>Moses</HI> said to him, excuse me this time also, if I demand ought else of thee, abandon me. They coninued their way unto a Village, where the Inha∣bitants refused them bread; at that time they found a wall ruined, which he raised again; <HI>Moses</HI> said unto him, thou shouldst have been payed for repairing this wall, if thou wouldest: He answered, now behold the place of our separation, nevertheless I will explain to thee what thou we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t impatient to learn. That boat belongeth to two poor men, who labour on the sea to gain their subsistance, I would have pierced it, to preserve it to those poor men,
<PB N="187" REF="104"/>
because there was an Infidell Prince, who by force seized on the good vessels for his service. That infant which I flew was an Idolater, the son of a true believer, a righte∣ous man; we feared he might cause his father to sin, and seduce him into his error, and infidelity; the Lord through his goodness would have him to be destroyed, to deliver his father from his malice. The wall appertain∣eth to two infant Orphans of this City, there is under it a treasure that belongeth to them, their father was a righteous man, God through his goodness willeth: that the treasure be preserved for them, untill they attain to years of discretion; he likewise willed me to do what I have done: behold the exposition of what thou wert im∣patient to learn. If any one enquire of thee concerning <HI>Alexander</HI> the great, relate to them his History: we gave him on earth what he desired, he went as far as the West, where he found a fountain guarded by a man, who said to him, O <HI>Alexander</HI>! chastise men through the murther of their persons, bondage, and ransome; he answered, I will put to death unbelievers in this world, and the Lord shall punish them in hell, and the righteous shall enjoy the glory of Paradise; I will tell the wicked, that God hath given us what we have desired. After this, he con∣tinued his way untill he came to a place, where the Sun riseth; he found that it riseth in a countrey, where they have nothing to shelter them from its heat, the thing is so: we taught <HI>Alexander</HI> how to shelter himself; he fol∣lowed his way, untill he arrived between two mountains, inhabited of a Nation that spake a Language, which he could hardly understand; they said to him, O <HI>Alexander! Jagog,</HI> and <HI>Magog</HI> defile the earth, canst thou put be∣tween them and us an obstacle, to hinder that they may not come to us? God, said <HI>Alexander,</HI> hath not given me means to do it; but assist me with your power, I will put between them and you a strong separation; give me iron that can cut stones, that I may build betwixt the two mountains, and that I may fortifie the way that devideth them; blow when the iron striketh the stones, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>indle fire, and poure on m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lten brass to joyn the stones and
<PB N="188" REF="105"/>
iron together; if they come, they cannot pierce through the mountains, neither find a way to come to you, this is a favour which God conferreth on you, his promises are infallible; when the hour arriveth, he is true in what hee promiseth; we will permit them to mixe each with other; we will assemble all of them when the Trumpet shall sound; then will we open Hell to the wicked, and to such as would neither see, nor hear the <HI>Alcoran</HI>; Do they ima∣gine them that worship me to be their gods? we have prepared hell to punish them. Say unto them, shall I re∣late unto thee what shall befall the damned, their works shall be unprofitable in this world, although they think to do well; good works are unprofitable to them that con∣temn the Commandements of their Lord, and believe not in the Resurrection, they shall not want ballance at the day of Judgement; hell shall be their habitation, be∣cause they deride our Commandements, and our Apostles, and Prophets; The righteous shall enjoy eternally the delight of Paradise without discontinuation. If the sea were inke, to write the wondrous works of my Lord, it will sooner have an end, then his miracles: Say unto the Infi∣dels, I am a man like you, God hath taught me that there is but one God; he that believeth in the Resurrection, studieth to do good works; worship but one God, who is without a companion.</P>

<P>IN the Name of God, gracious and merciful: God is the rewarder, conductor, (of the righteous) liberall, wise, true: <HI>Zachery,</HI> the servant of thy Lord remembred his grace, when he in secret prayed to his Lord, and said, Lord, my bones are become feeble, and mine head is white with old age; Lord, I was never rejected in my prayers, hear my petition, give me a son to succeed me, that may be mine heir, heir of the lineage of <HI>Jacob,</HI> and
<PB N="189" REF="105"/>
be pleasing to thee. O <HI>Zachary</HI>! I declare unto thee, that thou shalt have a son, named <HI>John,</HI> no man hath yet been called by that name; he said, Lord, how shall I have a son, my wife is barren, and I am too old? It was answe∣red him, the thing shall be as I have said unto thee, it is easie to thy Lord; who created thee; he said, Lord give me some signe of the conception of my wife; he said to him, thou shalt not speak for three nights. Then went he out of his Oratory, and made signes to the people, to make their prayers evening and morning. Oh <HI>John</HI>!<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Kitab el tenoir.</HI></NOTE> learn the Scripture with affection; We from his infancie gave him knowledge, clemency, charity, piety, affection to∣wards his father and mother, and not violence and diso∣bedience. We blessed the day of his nativity, the day that he shall dye, and the day that he shall rise again. Remem∣ber thou what is written of <HI>Mary,</HI> she retired towards the East, into a place farre remote from her kindred, and took a vaile to cover her, we sent her our Spirit in forme of a man; she was afraid, and said, God will preserve me from thee, if thou have his fear before thine eyes; hee said, oh <HI>Mary</HI>! I am the Messenger of God thy Lord, who shall give thee a Sonne, active, and prudent: She an∣swered, how shall I have a sonne without the touch of man? I desire not to be unchaste; he said, The thing shall be as I have told thee, it is facile to thy Lord; thy sonne shall be a token of the omnipotency of God, and of his speciall grace towards such as shall believe in his divine <HI>Majesty</HI>; She became with child, and retired some time, into a place remote from people, where she sustained the colours of Child-birth, at the foot of a Date-tree, and said, why am I not dead? wherefore am I not in the num∣ber of persons forgotten? The Angell said to her, afflict not thy selfe; God hath placed a brook under thee, shake the foot of this Palme, and the Dates shall fall, gather them up, eat and drink, and wash thine eyes, say unto them that thou shalt meet, that thou fastest, and hast made a vow not to speak to any one, untill thy fast be accom∣plished. Her parents met her while she bare her Infant,
<PB N="190" REF="106"/>
and said unto her, oh <HI>Mary</HI>! behold a strange thing; oh sister of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ron</HI>! thy father did not command thee to doe evill, neither was thy mother unchaste; She made signes to her infant to answer them; they said, how shall the in∣fant in the Cradle speak? Then her infant spake, and said, I am the servant of God, hee hath taught me the Scripture, hath made me a Prophet, blessed me in all places, and commanded me to pray unto him; hoe hath recommended to me purity through the whole course of my life, and to honour my father and mother; hee hath not made me either violent or malicious, praysed shall be the day of my birth, the day that I shall dye, and the day of my resurrection. Thus spake Jesus, the sonne of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y,</HI> with truth, of which ye doubt: God approveth not the discourse of them that say he hath a sonne; praised be God, when he willeth any thing, he saith, be thou, and it is; he is mine and your Lord, worship him, this is the right way; there be persons, who in this regard have been of different opinion, but misery is upon the incrudu∣lous, they shall be miserable at the day of Judgement. The Infidels are manifestly erroneous from the right way; If thou preach to them the torments of Hell and their ignorance, they will not hear thee. Wee are Lords of whatsoever is on Earth, and dispose of every thing at our pleasure, they shall be one day assembled before us to be judged. Remember thou what is written of <HI>Abraham,</HI> he was a righteous man, and a Prophet, he said to his Father, adore not what neither seeth; nor understandeth any thing, and that cannot be profitable; I know what ye know not, follow me, and I will conduct you into the right way; worship not the Devill, he is disobedient un∣to God; otherwise I fear that God may chastise you, and you may be in the number of the damned. He answered, oh <HI>Abraham</HI>! dost thou abhorre my Gods? unlesse thou change thy discourse, I will stone thee, depart from me for a long time; he said, May God inspire you, I will pray for you, he is exceeding good, and will hear my prayers; Whom will ye adore, when I shall be gone from
<PB N="191" REF="106"/>
you? Worship God my Lord, and your prayers shall be heard; he departed from them, and worshipped one God: We gave him two sonnes, <HI>Iasaac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> both Prophets, we conferred our grace upon him, with an elo∣quent and true tongue. Remember thou what is written of <HI>Moses</HI> he was a righteous man, our Prophet and Mes∣senger; we called him on the right side of the Mount <HI>Si∣nai,</HI> drew him neer unto us, and taught him our secrets; We through speciall g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> gave him a brother, named <HI>Aaron</HI> Remember thou what is written of <HI>Ismael,</HI> he ex∣actly observed what he promised, was a Prophet, and an Apostle of the Lord, preached purity, and recommended to men to make their prayers often, and was pleasing to his Lord. Remember thou what is written of <HI>Enoch,</HI> hee was a just man, and a Prophet, and we took him up to an exceeding high place. God gave his grace to these men, among the Prophets of the lineage of <HI>Adam,</HI> among them whom we caused to embarke with <HI>Noah,</HI> among those of the lineage of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and <HI>Israel,</HI> and among those that we assembled and guided into the right way. When the miracles of the mercifull were related to them, they fell prostrate, and adored him with tears in their eyes; their posterity forsook their footsteps, abandoned the Law, and followed their own appetites; but they shall be precipitated into Hell, except such as shall be converted, and do good works, they shall enter into Paradise, and no injustice shall be done to them, they shall enter into the garden of <HI>Eden</HI>; what the mercifull [God] doth promise, is infallible; they shall hear nothing spoken in Paradise that shall displease them, they shall hear the salutation of Angels, and morning and evening shall have what they desire; such is Paradise, which God giveth to his crea∣tures that have his fear before their eyes. I <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Gelal∣din</HI> saith, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that <HI>Ma∣homet</HI> complain∣eth to the Angel <HI>Ga∣briel</HI> for having been so long absent from him.</NOTE> descend not from Heaven▪ but by the permission of the Lord, he is master of our actions in Heaven and Earth, and of whatsoever is between them, he hath not forgot thee, wor∣ship him, and persevere in thy adoration, knowest thou any person that is named, like him?

shall I dye and rise again? He considereth not that God hath created him of nothing; I will one day assemble the Infidels, and Devils, I will cause them to appear at the gate of Hell upon their knees, and will cast upon them all manner of misery, because they have encreased their impiety towards their Lord. I know such as deserve to burn in Hell, they shall be thrown thither headlong, this is a most just sentence pronounced by the Lord. I will save the righteous, and forbid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> fidels to fall on their knees before Idols: when the unbelievers, and many of the faithfull heard my Commandements preached, they said among themselves, that they were in a better way then their neighbour; how many have we destroyed be∣for them, in past Ages, more rich then they, and hypo∣crites like unto them? Say unto them, God prolongeth the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe of the erroneous, that they may know their er∣rors, and learn the knowledge of the pains prepared for them, they shall understand who shall be the most misera∣ble; and who shall have been most weak in their faith, and least affectionate to the service of his divine Maje∣sty; God shall encrease their faith, who shall follow the right way; and such as be obedient to him, shall enjoy his grace. Hast thou considered the action of the wicked? They demand, if they shall have riches and children af∣ter their Resurrection? Would you know what shall be? would you capitulate with the mercifull? I will not do it; I will write all that they say, and will adde to their mise∣ries; I will give to them in this world, what they require, and they shall rise again naked (without treasure, and children.<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Gelal∣din.</HI></NOTE>) They adored Idols, to have their protection.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the name of God gracious and mercifull. We have not given thee the <HI>Alcoran</HI> to torment thee, but to in∣struct therein the righteous. It was sent thee by him, that created the Heavens and the Earth; the mercifull sitteth on his Throne; whatsoever is in Heaven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Earth, whatsoever is between them, and beneath the Earth, appertaineth to him. He knoweth thy thoughts, he
<PB N="194" REF="108"/>
understandeth what thou keepest secret, and what thou makest manifest. God! there is but one God, all the glorious names of the world are due unto him. Knowest thou the History of <HI>Moses?</HI> When he beheld the fire, he said to his family, Stay ye here, I see a great fire, I will bring to you a spark, and you shall find in it the right way. When he approached, it was said unto him, O <HI>Mo∣ses</HI>! I am thy Lord, put off thy shooes, thou art in the holy Valley of <HI>Toy,</HI> I have elected thee among my people, hear my word, and receive mine inspirations; I am God, there is none other God but I, worship me alone, and make thy prayers as it is ordained; The hour unknown to the world approacheth, wherein I will recompence and chastise every one after his works: Take heed lest the wicked seduce thee from the right way; if thou follow their appetite, thou shalt be destroyed; Is it not what thou hast sworn to me? he answered, Lord, I will apply my selfe unto thee, and will lean upon my staffe; I will beat the fruits of the Trees to make them fall upon my flocks; I have yet another manner to nourish my sheep with this staff; I will make use of it to defend, and pre∣serve them from mischief; God said unto him, O <HI>Moses!</HI> cast that staffe to the ground, behold a Serpent, it creep∣eth, take it, and be not afraid, I will cause it to return to its former condition; draw back thine hand, and put it under thy arm it shall become white and shining, without harm, and pain, it shall be a most certain sign of my Uni∣ty, I will give thee to see the miracles of my Omnipoten∣cie; go to <HI>Pharoah,</HI> he is in an exceeding great error, and seduced from the right way: <HI>Moses</HI> said, Lord, rejoyce my heart, and facilitate my commission, unloose the knot of my tongue, that they may understand my speech: give me <HI>Aaron</HI> to assist me in this business, that I may praise thee, and highly exalt thy glory, thou only art our protector. God said, thy prayer is heard, we were favourable to thee another time, when we inspired thy mother to put thee into a coffer, and expose thee to the river of <HI>Nile</HI>; the wa∣ter drove thee to the shore, whence <HI>Pharoah</HI> took thee;
<PB N="195" REF="108"/>
I caused thee to be beloved of him, to have care of my peo∣ple; when thy sister sought t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dings of what was become of thee, she said, who will guide us where he is? who will conduct us to him that keepeth him? we sent thee back to thy mother, to stop her tears, and put an end to her affe∣ction. Thou slewest a man, we have delivered thee from the hands of thine enemies, and have approved thy per∣severance; thou hast continued some time with the in∣habitants of <HI>Madian</HI>; after this we sent thee to preach our Commandements; I have made choise of thee, goe with thy brother to <HI>Pharoah,</HI> and lie not in speaking of me, he is gone astray from the right way; speak to him both of you, with mildnesse, peradventure he will hearken to you, and will fear the fire of hell; they answered, Lord, wee fear that he may torment, and rise up against us; he said, fear nothing, I will be with you, hear what he will say, consider his actions; address your selves to him, and say, we are the Messengers of the Omnipotent God; dismiss with us the children of <HI>Israel,</HI> and no more torment them, we are come hither by the Commandement of God, thy Lord. Salvation is for such as follow the right way; dam∣nation for them that blaspheme against his Law, and de∣part from his Commandements; <HI>Pharoah</HI> said unto them, who is your God? <HI>Moses</HI> said, my God is he that created the world, and guideth men into the right way. <HI>Pharoah</HI> said, what law did your predecessors observe? what is be∣come of them? <HI>Moses</HI> answered, God knoweth in what con∣dition they are; nothing is concealed from God, he ex∣tended the earth, and established the wayes; he causeth rain to descend from heaven, and maketh to spring forth the plants, herbs, and fruits which ye eat, and that nourish your flocks. These things are signs of his Omnipotency to them that understand them. We created you of earth, and to earth will we make you to return, and will cause you to come out of it once again; we shewed miracles to <HI>Pharoah,</HI> but he was incredulous, contemned them, and said, O <HI>Mo∣ses</HI>! Are thou come to drive us out of our Dominions with thy Magick? I will shew thee [Magick] like to thine; let us
<PB N="196" REF="109"/>
meet at a place, and day prefixed between the and me, to come together; <HI>Moses</HI> said unto him, let us make choise of the day of your feast; if it seem good to you, the people may assemble at the Sun rising: After this discourse, <HI>Pha∣roah</HI> withdrew, recollected all his subtilties, and at the day and hour prefixed, came with his people to the place appointed, where <HI>Moses</HI> was, who said unto them, misery is upon you, blaspheme not against God, he will punish you, and destroy them that blaspheme against him; The people of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> differed in opinion what they should do, kept their designe secret, and said to <HI>Pharoah,</HI> these two men are Magicians, they would chase you from your Countrey, through their Magick, and seduce your sub∣jects from your Religion; recollect your subtilties and power, and chuse persons capable to dispute against them, this day shall be happy to him that shall be victo∣rious. They said to <HI>Moses,</HI> wilt thou first cast thy staffe on the ground, or shall we ours? Their cords and staves a∣rose against <HI>Moses</HI> through their Magick, and crawled: <HI>Moses</HI> spake low, between his teeth; we said unto him, fear nothing, thou shalt be victorious, cast thy staffe in thy right hand on the ground, it shall devoure what they have done, it is but witchcraft and magick that produceth neither Profit nor Content. Then fell the Magicians of <HI>Pharoah</HI> prostrate on the ground, and said, We believe in the God of <HI>Aaron</HI> and <HI>Moses; Pharoah</HI> said unto them, believe ye in him without my permission? <HI>Moses</HI> is your master, I will cut off your right feet, and your left hands; or your left feet, and your right hands, and cause you to be hanged on Palme trees, that ye may know who is the more severe in his chastisements, I, or the God of <HI>Moses</HI>; They said, the miracles that thou hast seen, have they not touched thee? He that created us, doth things which are not in thy power to performe; thy power ex∣tendeth only in this world, we believe in God our Lord, who will pardon our sinnes; thou art the cause that hee abhorreth us with our magick, hee is more power∣full then thou, and eternall; Hell is prepared for Infidels,
<PB N="197" REF="109"/>
they shall finde repose neither in their life nor death, and the righteous that shall do good works, shall eternally enjoy the pleasures of the gardens of <HI>Eden,</HI> wherein slow many delicious rivers, such is the reward of them that are purged from their sins. We said unto <HI>Moses,</HI> go out by night with my people, and make them a drie path through the Sea, fear not that thine enemies may over∣take thee, neither be afraid of being drowned, <HI>Paraoh</HI> shall follow them with his troops; I will overwhelm in the sea, and will mislead him with his people, he shall not follow the right way. O children of <HI>Israel</HI>! we delivered you from your enemies, and conducted you towards the mountains of <HI>Sinai:</HI> we caused Manna and Quailes to de∣scend upon you, and said, eat ye of the good things that we have given you, and be not ungratefull, otherwise my wrath shall fall upon you; he upon whom mine indigna∣tion shall fall, shall be thrown headlong into the fire of hell; I will be mercifull to such as shall convert, do good works, and follow the right way. O <HI>Moses</HI>! who pressed thee to absent thy self from thy people? He answered, be∣hold he that followeth my steps, I am come up to receive thy Commandements. We after thy departure estranged thy people from thee, and <HI>Samery</HI> seduced them from the right way; he returned upon his steps to his people, in great displeasure, and said, O ye people! did not God promise to you all manner of content? he protracted the effect of his promises, because of your sins, will you that his wrath fall upon you? wherefore have ye transgressed what ye promised to me? They said, we have not trans∣gressed our promises of our own accord; we took the most weighty ornaments of the people, and cast them into the fire, <HI>Samery</HI> himself did cast them in; he made the bo∣dy of a bellowing Calfe, and said, with his followers, behold there your God, the God of <HI>Moses</HI> whom he hath forgotten; Saw they not that this Calf spake not to them, and that it had not power to do good or evill? <HI>Aaron</HI> had said unto them, before the comming of <HI>Mo∣ses</HI>; O ye people! you have been seduced by this Calfe;
<PB N="198" REF="110"/>
the mercifull is your God, and your Lord, follow and o∣bey me: They said, shall we abide here untill <HI>Moses</HI> re∣turne? <HI>Moses</HI> at his return said unto <HI>Aaron</HI> what hindred thee to follow me, when thou sawest them to turne aside from the Law of God? wherefore hast thou disobeyed me? O son of my mother! (said <HI>Aaron</HI>) drag me not by the beard, and haire, I feared to displease thee, if I forsook the children of <HI>Israel,</HI> and disobey thy Commandements; <HI>Moses</HI> said unto <HI>Samery,</HI> what was thy design? he answered, I saw what this people seeth not, I took an handfull of the earth of the footsteps of the Messenger of God, and made the Figure of a Calfe, the fairest that I could; <HI>Moses</HI> said unto him, goe, get thee from among us, thou shalt fly the presence of men all the dayes of thy life; thou shalt say unto them, come not nigh me, touch me not, the time of thy punishment is appointed, thou shalt not escape it, behold thy false god, behold the Calfe which thou hast adored, I will cause it to burne, and will cast the ashes thereof into the sea; your God is one God, and there is none other God, but the God that knoweth all things: Thus doe I relate to thee things past; we have sent thee the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> such as shall abjure it, shall beare their burthen at the day of Judgement, and be eternal∣ly tormented; I will one day require an account of their burden, and will assemble them with all their subtilities; when the Trumpet shall sound, they shall demand of each other, how long they have continued in the world? they shall say, that they have remained there but ten dayes and ten nights, I know all that they will say; the most prudent among them shall say, that they have been but one day. They shall enquire of thee concerning the Mountains; Say unto them, God shall teare them up, and levell them with the Earth, thou shalt see them levelled and beaten downe: then shall men without retardment follow him that shall summon them to universall Judge∣ment, they shall humble themselves before God, thou shalt that day heare low and humble voyces, that day shall prayers be ineffectuall, except of them that shall be

pleasing to God, whom he will permit to speak. He knoweth whatsoever men doe in this world, and what must befall them in the other, and they know it not, they shall humble themselves, and hang down the head before the living and eternall Lord, all Infidels shall be dam∣ned, and the righteous of True-believers that have done good works, shall not feare injustice. We have sent the <HI>Alcoran</HI> in the <HI>Arabique</HI> tongue, it teacheth men our Commandements, peradventure they will feare impiety; it teacheth them what they ought to know; Exalt the glory of God, King of the world, he is truth it selfe; presse not thy selfe to read the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> untill thou hast well understood it. Say, Lord encrease my knowledge; We heretofore prohibited <HI>Adam</HI> to eat of the forbidden fruit, he was unmindfull of our Commandement, I found in him no perseverance. Remember thou that we com∣manded the Angels to humble themselves before him, they humbled themselves, except the Devill, who refu∣sed to doe it. Remember that we said, <HI>Adam,</HI> the Devill is thine enemy, and the enemy of thy wife, he will en∣deavour to make you miserable, to cause you both to goe out of Paradise, where thou sufferest neither hunger nor thirst, nor cold, nor heat; The Devill tempted them, and said, oh <HI>Adam</HI>! I will conduct thee to the tree of eternity, a treasure that shall never perish, they did both eat of the fruit of that tree, then knew they their filthi∣nesse, and took the leaves of trees to cover their naked∣nesse; <HI>Adam</HI> disobeyed his Lord, and became miserable, neverthelesse he heard, and pardoned him, and shewed him the right way; he said, discend from Paradise, ye enemies of each other, I will hereafter send you a guide, he that shall follow him, shall not erre, and shall be bles∣sed; He that shall goe astray, and will not believe in me, shall be miserable in the world, and blind at the day of Judgement; that day shall he say, Lord, wherefore hast thou made me blind▪ I had good sight when I was in the world: I did this day forget thee, as thou didst forget my Commandements: thus doe I intreat Infidels. The tor∣ments
<PB N="200" REF="111"/>
of the other world are more grievous then those of the Earth, and of longer continuance; doe not unbelie∣vers tremble, when they consider how many men upon Earth we have destroyed in past Ages? Their misery shall serve for example to them that are wise; Had not thy Lord said, that he will deferre the punishment of the wicked untill the time appointed, he had already destroy∣ed them. Be patient, and endure their discourse, praise thy Lord before the Sunne arise, before it setteth, an hour before night, and at the end of day thou shalt doe a thing acceptable to him: The life of the world is sweet to tempt you, but the riches of thy Lord are better, and e∣ternall. Command the people to make their prayers at the time appointed, and be not impatient towards them, I require no riches of thee, I will enrich thee, and in the end Paradise shall be for the righteous. The un∣believers have said, if <HI>Mahomet</HI> sheweth not some racle from God, and knoweth not the exposition of the books of our predecessors, we will not believe in him; We before his comming destroyed many wicked persons, who said, Lord, hadst thou sent us a Prophet, we had observed thy Commandements, before we became infa∣mous, and laden with ignominie; Say unto them, eve∣ry one expecteth his end, expect ye, and ye shall one day know them that follow the right way, and have not erred.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI. The Chapter of the Prophets, containing an hundred and twelve Verses, written at <HI>Mecca.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the Name of God, gracious and mercifull. The day approacheth, wherein the people shall render an accompt of their actions, but they consider it not, and depart from the Commandements of God; if they heare them, they laugh, they understand them not, and keep secret their e∣vill intention. Is not <HI>Mahomet</HI> a man like to you? Will ye
<PB N="201" REF="111"/>
say that he is a Magician? you see the contrary; God hea∣reth whatsoever is spoken, both in Heaven and Earth, and knoweth all things. They say, certainly <HI>Mahomet</HI> hath dreamed what he speaketh, he hath invented it, and is a Poet, we will not believe him, unless he shew some mira∣cle, as did the Prophets that were before him. We have layed waste many Cities, because their inhabitants were incredulous; we sent before thee but men who were in∣spired of us; Enquire of them, to whom heretofore was given the knowledge of the written Law, if ye know it not; they were men that did eat and drink, and were mor∣tal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; we effected what we promised to them, we preserved them with such as believed, and destroyed the incredulous; We have sent you a Book to instruct you, will ye under∣stand it? How many Infidel Cities have wee made deso∣late? How many new people have we established in their place? When they felt our punishment, they fled; fly not, and return to what hath delighted you, return into your houses, peradventure ye will yet cover the riches of the Earth; They said, misery is upon us, we are too blame; Thus did they talke, untill they were destroyed. We have not created Heaven and Earth, and whatsoever is between them, to sport with; had it been our will that they should have scoffed on Earth, they should scoffe likewise in Heaven. On the contrary, I oppose the truth to false∣hood, to confound it, and in effect it doth confound it. Misery shall be upon you, because of your blasphemies; whatsoever is in Heaven and Earth, is Gods; the Angels are not ashamed to worship him, they prayse him day and night, and exalt his glory without blasphemie. The Infidels worship Gods made of Earth; Have they power to create any thing? Were there in Heaven, and on Earth another God, they would not accord; praised be God, Lord of the Uni∣verse; what the Infidels relate, is untrue. Hee asketh no counsell when he will doe any thing, as do men; will they worship any other God but him? Say unto them, produce your arguments, behold what we have to speak
<PB N="202" REF="112"/>
unto you, behold our reasons, and those of our predeces∣sors; Certainly, the greatest part of them are igno∣rant of the truth, and goe astray. We inspired into all the Prophets which we sent, that there was but one God that ought to be worshipped. They said, believe ye that the Angels are the sonnes of God? Praysed be God; on the contrary, they are his creatures, he loveth them, they speak not but after him, and obey what he com∣mandeth them, he knoweth all their actions past, and future, they pray for no man but through his permission, and feare to displease him. Who among them will say I am God, instead of God? he shall be cast headlong into the fire of Hell; thus doe I intreat unbelievers. Know they not that the Heavens and the Earth were shut up? We opened them, and gave life to every thing, through the raine which we made to descend; will they not believe in my unity? We created the Mountains to hinder the Earth to move, we made therein wayes large and spacious for our Creatures, we covered it with the Heaven, and have exempted it from falling, neverthe∣lesse they despise our Commandement. It is the Lord who created day and night, the Moone and the Sunne, all things praise and exalt him in Heaven; we crea∣ted no person to dwell for over on Earth; all men shall taste of death, I will prove you with good and evill, and ye shall appeare before me to give accompt of your acti∣ons: The Infidels scoffe at you, when they see you, and say, behold them that deride our Gods! They obey not the Commandements of God; he created man of dust, and shall shew you the effects of his omnipotency, be not impatient to see the punishment of the wicked, who say, when shall be the day of judgement? did they know it, they would remove the fire from their backs and vi∣sages; that day shall surprize them, it shall astonish them when they thinke least of it, they cannot retard it, and shall be deprived of protection. Certainly they scorned the Prophets that were sent before thee, but they were punished after their demerits. Say unto them,
<PB N="203" REF="112"/>
who but the mercifull [God] preserveth you day and night? neverthelesse yee reject his Commandements; Have they any other God but me, that is able to save them? Their Gods cannot defend themselves: I will not protect them, yet will I enrich them, as I enriched their fathers, and will prolong their life, to punish them on Earth; Know they not that their estates di∣minish on all sides through thy Conquests? Is it so, that they are victorious? Say unto them, I preach to you what God hath inspired into me, but the deafe heare not when they are exhorted; When they are a little touched with the chastisements of God, they say, oh mi∣sery! We are too blame, and are unjust; I will weigh their workes at the day of Judgement, that I may doe injustice to no person, of the weight of a grain of mu∣stard-seed, and will most exactly accompt. We gave to <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> the Book that distinguisheth good from evill, and commanded them to preach our Commande∣ments to them that had our feare before their eyes. That Booke is blessed, and was sent from us; never∣thelesse unbelievers reject and condemne it. We here∣tofore instructed <HI>Abraham</HI> in the right way, and knew that he was a righteous man. Remember thou that he said to his father, and his people, what Idols doe ye adore? They said, wee find that our Fathers adore<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them; he said unto them, your fathers and you were exceedingly erroneous: they said, dost thou speak the truth, or dost thou jeast? He said, Certainely your Lord is the Lord of Heaven and Earth, I sweare to you that he created them; Having convinced those Idola<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, he said, by God, I will make Warne upon your Idol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, he broke them with an hatchet in their absence, except the gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atest Idoll, on which he hung his hatchet, and said, peradventure they will accuse him to have bro∣ken the other: Seeing at their returne their Idols broken, they said, who hath in this mannner hand∣led our Gods? He is impious; we heard it is a young man, named <HI>Abraham,</HI> who derideth them, bring
<PB N="204" REF="113"/>
him before the eyes of the people, perhaps they shall find witnesses of his Action. They said unto him, oh <HI>Abra∣ham</HI>! it is thou that hast so abused our Gods, he said on the contrary, it is that great Idol; They enquired of each other if those Idols spake, and if they had mo∣tion; afterwards they returned to themselves, and said to the people, ye are too blame to adore those Idols; he threw them headlong against the ground, and they said, oh <HI>Abram</HI>! thou well knewest that they spake not at all; he answered, why therefore doe ye wor∣ship what can neither benefit nor hurt you? You defile your selves in adoring them instead of God, doe ye not know him? Then they said, burne <HI>Abraham,</HI> and let us defend our Gods, if ye are righteous men: but we commanded the fire to lose its heat, to preserve <HI>Abra∣ham</HI>; They would have tormented him, and we de∣stroyed them, we saved him, as we preserved <HI>Lot,</HI> we conducted him into the Land of blessing, gave him <HI>Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> and the Children of their Chil∣dren, righteous men, and True-believers, to instruct the people in the way of Salvation; wee inspired them to doe good workes, to pray at the time ap∣pointed, to pay Tithes, and to worship us; Wee gave to <HI>Lot</HI> prudence and knowledge, and delivered him from the Inhabitants of the City, who were the most vicious upon Earth, we were gracious to him, because he was righteous. Remember <HI>Noah,</HI> and that hee heretofore invoked us; wee heard his prayer, and delivered him from great danger, and all that were with him in the Arke; we deli∣vered him from the hand of the wicked, whom wee drowned. Remember <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Salomon,</HI> who ren∣dred Justice in the field, whereinto the flocks of the village entred by night without Shepheards; wee are witnesse of their Judgements, wee instructed <HI>Sa∣lomon</HI> in Justice, we gave his prudence and knowledge; the Mountaines adored us with <HI>David,</HI> and with him
<PB N="201" REF="113"/>
the Birds praised us; we were with them when they praised us. We taught you the manner of sowing [seed] to preserve you from necessity; peradventure ye will be thankfull to me. We commanded the winds to obey <HI>Solo∣mon,</HI> and know all that he did. The devils obeyed him, they dived into the sea, to fis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i for Gems for him, and travelled also in other matters; and we hindered them to act mischief against men. Remember <HI>Job,</HI> who prayed to his Lord and said, I am in exceeding great affliction; thou art the mer∣ciful of the merciful: we heard him, &amp; delivered him from his affliction; gave to him our grace, &amp; to his family, &amp; to them that were with him, who had patience, and trusted in me. Remember <HI>Ismael, Enoch,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Delcafel</HI> is <HI>Ely.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Delcafel</HI> &amp; <HI>Zachary,</HI> they persevered in wel doing; we gave them our grace because they were righteous. Remember <HI>Jonas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See the book com∣posed by <HI>Abdel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI></NOTE> who forsooke his people in displeasure; he beleived I could doe nothing a∣gainst him; but he cryed in the dark, and said, There is no God besides thee, praised be thy name; I am too blame for having offended thee: We heard him, and delivered him from his disaster. Thus do I protect true-beleivers, when they invoke me. Remember <HI>Zachary,</HI> who made his prayer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and said, Lord, <HI>I</HI> know there is no better heir in the world then thy self; yet let me not dy without issue: We heard his request, gave him a son, named <HI>Jon,</HI> and rendred his wife fruitfull. All these Prophets went on with alacrity to do well, and invoked us with humility, with desire to ob∣tain our grace, &amp; with fear of the torments of hel. Remem∣ber <HI>Mary,</HI> whose womb I blessed; we inspired into her our Spirit, &amp; gave her a Son, a miracle in the world. Your law is on onely law, and I am one only God, worship me, &amp; be not impious; ye all shal appear before me to be judged, I will protect the true believers that shall have done good works, &amp; wil write what they shall do for their reward. M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sery is upon the Cities that we have ruined; their in∣habitants shall not return into the world, untill the passage be opened to <HI>Jagog</HI> and <HI>Magog,</HI> and they come running from the eminent places of the earth; then shall the day of Iudgment approach; the promised Truth shall not be far off, it shall trouble the sight of the wicked. Who shall say
<PB N="202" REF="114"/>
O misery! We are miserable, we did not foresee this dis∣aster; we have been excedingly too blame for having of∣fended God. It shall be said unto them, ye worshipped in∣stead of God, the firebrands of Hell, into which ye shall be cast headlong: Had your Idols been Gods, as ye be∣leived, they should not have entred Hell; they, and those that have adored them, shal be eternally damned; they shall groan, complain, and shal not be heard: Such as shall be in paradise, shall be far remote from them: they shall not hear their howlings, and shall enjoy eternally what they shall desire, the cryes of the damned shall not afflict them; the Angels shall meet them when they come out of their graves, and shall say, Behold now the day that was foretold you in the world; a day, wherein wee will open the heavens, and the book of the accompt of all men, as we promised to your predecessors. We exactly perform what we promise; we have written in the Old Testament, and afterwards in the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> That the righteous shall inherit the Earth: This Book shall teach the way to Paradise to them that shall worship mee: We had not sent thee, but in favour of men; say unto them God hath alwayes inspired into me, that your God is one God, will ye not obey him? If they go astray, I have taught you how they must be intreated. Say unto them, I know not whether the punishment denounced to you shall be speedy, or tardy. God knoweth what is known, and unknowne in the world, I know not whether he will try you, or defer his punishment untill the time appoin∣ted: He is a most just judg, and most mercifull, he is not such as ye speak him.</P>

The Earthquake that shall happen at the day of Judgment shall be wonderfull; ye shall that day see mothers forget their children, and every one shall bear his own burden; ye shall see men drunk, not with Wine, but amazed and astonished at the great j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dgments of God. There be, who dispute of the Deity with igno∣rance, and follow the will of the Devill, voluntary and obstinate: It is written, he shall seduce them that obey him, and shall conduct them into Hell. O ye people! if ye doubt of the Resurrection, consider how we created you of the dust of the Earth; with a little water sprinkled upon the dust, with congeaied blood, and a little flesh in∣tirely, and not intirely formed. I form in the Wombs of Women, what seemeth good to me, at the time appointed. I cause you to come forth children, then I give you life, and make you to arrive to the age of virility; some die young, and others live to extremity of age, to the end they may learn to live well. Consider the Earth, dry, dead, and barren; when we shall cause rain to fall, it shall change the face, shall produce and nourish its fruits of all sorts, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>air, and pleasing. Because God is truth it selfe, he raiseth a∣gain the deed, and is Omnipotent. There is no doubt but the day of Iudgement approacheth, and that God will cause the dead to rise again. There be men that dispute of God without knowledge, without reason, without au∣thority, and go astray from the way of his Law; they shall be ful of ignominy and shame in this world, and shall feel in the other, the pains of Hel. God doth no injustice to his people. There be who adore him with scruple; if good befall them, they persevere to adore him; if evill, they re∣turne to their impiety, and l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se the riches of Earth, and the riches of Heaven: These tw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> losses are exce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding great

they invok Idols instead of God; they invoke what can neither benefit, nor hurt them; Such prayers are by-ways, far remote from the Commandements of God; they wor∣shi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that which doth rather mischief, nor advantage them. Certainly, God shall make the True-believers, that do good works, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nter into Gardens, wherein flow many Rivers; he doth w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at seemeth good to him. He that is an∣gry, that God giveth succour, and protection to <HI>Mahomet</HI> in this world,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See KITA. BEL tenior.</NOTE> and in the other, let him tye a cord to a beam of his house, and hang himselfe; he shall see if his choller will be allayed. God hath sent the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> as heretofore he sent the other Scriptures; it containeth his Commandements, clear and intel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igible; it guideth into the right way whom it pleaseth him: He at the day of Judgement shall judge the differences that are betweene the faithful, &amp; Infidels; between the <HI>Samaritans,</HI> the Chri∣stians, and Idolaters; he is omniscient. Seest thou not that all that is in Heaven, and on Earth, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the Mountains, Trees, and Beasts, adore him? Many worship him with zeal, but many likewise merit to be pu∣nished: None shall esteem him, whom God shall despise, he doth as seemeth good to him. These two contrary parti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Believers and the Infidels, have disputed of the Deity; but the Infidels shall be encompassed with flames of Hell, they shall have shirts of fire, boyling water shall flow in up∣on their heads; the fire shall burn what is in their bellies, &amp; shall roast their skin, they shall be beaten with clubs of I∣ron; when they think to go out of this fire, they shall enter further into it, and be eternally tormented. God shal cause the True-believers, that have don good wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks, to go into Gardens, wherein flow many Rivers; they shall be adorned with bracelets of Gold, and Pearls; they shall be clothed with Silk, and enjoy eternall felic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty, because they have professed his Unity; and the Infidels shall suffer great tor∣ments, for that they have hindred the people to imbrace t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Faith, and visit the Temple of <HI>Mecca,</HI> which God hath establis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to be therein adored of all the world: He that sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l be solicited to visit it, and shall enter it, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>gn to return to his impiety, shall be severely punished.
<PB N="205" REF="115"/>
Remember, that we shewed to <HI>Abraham</HI> the place to build the Temple of <HI>Mecca</HI>; that we commanded him to adore me alone, and to purge my Temple from Idols, for the satisfaction of them that should there make processions. Men shall come thither to visit thee from all parts, on foot, and on horse-back; they shall receive profit, they shall there make there prayers at the times appointed, and the days nominated; they shall thank the Lord for his be∣nefits towards them, and the riches which he hath giv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n them; and shall make likewise processions at the old Temple. He that shall reverence it, shall do exceeding well, and shall be recompenced of his Lord. It is lawfull for you to eat of all clean Beasts, except of such as have been heretofore prohibited: Depart from the pollution of Idols; beware of bearing false witnesse, and be obedient to God. He that saith, God hath a Companion, is like to him that fell head-long from Heaven, whom the Birds devoured, and the wind cast into a remote place, full of miseries. He that shall reverence the signes of the power of God, will not doubt of his Law, and shall be rewarded for his good works at the time appointed. If he visit the old Temple of <HI>Mecca.</HI> We have given to all Nations of the world a Law to offer their Sacrifices, and to return thanks to their Lord, for having given them advantage above all sorts of Beasts. Your God is one God, obey his Com∣mandements, proclaim a great reward to them that are o∣bedient to him, to them that tremble <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith fear, when they hear mention of his name; that are patient in their ad∣versity, that pray at the time appointed, and dispence in alms some part of the wealth that we have given them. We have created the female Camel for a sign of our uni∣ty, she shall be profitable to you in this world. Remem∣ber to pronounce the name of God, when ye shal sacrifice her, standing on her feet, when she shall fall dead on the ground, eat of her flesh, if it like you, &amp; give to eat to such as shall require it. We have made her subject to you;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pilgrims Sacrifice a Cammel at MECCA.</NOTE> per∣a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>venture ye wil be thankful to me for this grace. God pro∣moteth before him, neither the flesh of this Beast, nor the blood, but only the good works that ye perform. He hath
<PB N="206" REF="116"/>
thus subjected it; That ye may exalt it, and give him thanks for having guided you into the right way. Pro∣claim to the righteous, That God will remove far from them the malice of the wicked; he abhorreth Traytors, and the ingratefull: Declare to such as fight against Infidels, to repair the injury they have don them; that God is suffici∣ently powerfull to protect them. When they were dri∣ven from their houses without reason; they said, God is our Lord: Had not God stirred up the people against each other, the Covents of the Religious, the Churches of the Christians, the Synagogues of the Jews, and the Tem∣ples of the Believers, had been ruined, (through the mul∣titude of the wicked,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Gelal∣din.</HI></NOTE> and their malice.) The name of God is exalted in the Temples of believers, and therein is his Law defended and protected. God is most strong; he hath all power over his people. Those whom God hath established on Earth, with victory over their enemies, make their prayers in the maner ordained; pay Tythes, and enjoyn to do what is honest and civill; forbid to do what is prohibited of God, who knoweth the end of all things. If the Infid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls traduce thee, their predecessors tra∣duced <HI>Noah, A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, Chiab, Abraham,</HI> and <HI>Lot,</HI> they also slan∣dred <HI>Mos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI>: God for a time deferred their punishment, but in the end most severely chastised them. How ma∣ny Cities have we destroyed, because of their impiety? We have overthrown, and made them desart, through the death of their Inhabitants. Shall those of <HI>Mecca</HI> walk for ever upon Earth▪ with an hard heart, without reflecting upon what hath heretofore befalne the Infidels? Their eyes are not blinde, but their hearts are blinde, and hard∣ned: They will require thee to cause the wicked to be speedily chastised; God will not go against what he hath promised: One day before thy Lord, is as a thousand yeers before men. How often hath the punishments of impi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us Cities been deferred, that in the end were de∣str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yed? The whole world shall one day be assembled before me, to be recompenced after their merits. Say un∣to them, O people! I preach unto you publikely the tor∣ments of Hell, such as shall believe, and do good works,
<PB N="207" REF="116"/>
they shal receive pardon of their sins, &amp; a precious treasure; they that shall endevor to make voyd the faith shal be dam∣ned. We sent our Prophet to read only our Command∣ments to the People; the unbeleivers read many things that are not in the <HI>Alcoran</HI>; but God hath made vain what the Devil had there inserted, and confirmed the precepts of his Law: What the Devill there inserted, serveth for se∣dition to them that are weak in their faith, &amp; have an heart the Infidels are in an exceeding great error, &amp; are far from the Truth. Such as have the knowledg of Scripture, know that the <HI>Alcoran</HI> is truth it self, which proceedeth from thy Lord: They beleive in it, and humble their heart in rea∣ding it. God guideth into the right way such as beleive in the truth: The Infidels shall be in doubt, untill they be surprized of the day of Judgement. That day shall they be rigorously chastised, that day shall God command, and judg the good and the bad; the righteous that shall have be∣leived, and done good works, shall enter into delicious Gardens; and the Infidells that shall have disobeyed his Commandments, shall suffer exceeding great torments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Gelal∣din.</NOTE> They that departed from <HI>Mecca,</HI> and went to <HI>Medina,</HI> to a∣bandon the society of unbeleivers, and were slain; or died of sicknesse, shall be rewarded of his divine Majesty. God is the greatest benefactor in the world? he shal give them to en∣ter where they shall desire; he is omniscient, &amp; most merci∣ful. The believers that shall take revenge of the injury that the unbeleivers have done them, shall be protected of God; He is gracious and merciful towards his people; he maketh day to enter into night, &amp; night into day; he heareth the Prayers of True beleivers, and seeth whatsoever they do and will protect them, because he is truth it selfe. Idols are but vanity; &amp; God is most high, &amp; omnipotent. Dost thou not consider that God sendeth the rain from Heaven, and that the earth becommeth green? He is benign to his people, &amp; knoweth all [things;] whatsoever is in Heaven &amp; Earth, is his; he hath no need of his people and ought to be ex∣alted. Seest thou not that God hath subjected to you all the beasts that are upon the Earth? Seest thou not that the ship runneth upon the SEA, through his command, to
<PB N="208" REF="117"/>
transport you and your substance? Seest thou not, that he hindreth heaven to fal upon the earth? certainly he is be∣nign, and merciful; He it is that hath given you life and death, he shal make you to dy, and shall raise you againe, neverthelesse man is ingrateful for his favors. We have given a Law to all the Nations of the World, to guide them into the right way; if they observe it they will not dispute against thee. Invoke thy Lord, thou art in the right way; if they dispute against thee: Say unto them, God knoweth all your actions, he shal judg your diffe∣rences at the day of judgment: knewest thou not that God knoweth whatsoever is in heaven or in earth? All is written, &amp; this is most easie to his divine Maj. Idolaters adore without reason, Idols that understand not whether they be gods or no, that shall be without protection at the day of Judgment; when they preach to men my com∣mandements, they know by their countenance those that are impious, and ingratefull for my graces; they would with wrath fall upon them that instruct them. Say unto them, I declare unto you things more greivous: God hath prepared the fire of hell to chastise Infidels. O peo∣ple! A parable is related to you, hear it. All the Idolls that ye adore cannot create a flye; when they shall be assembled to do it, if the flies corrupt any thing that is offered to them, they have not the power to drive them away, because of their impotency, and the weaknesse of them that adore them: They praise not God in that manner as is just and reasonable, he is most strong, &amp; most powerfull, he hath chosen messengers to bear and and execute his Commandements among Angels and men, he heareth whatsoever they say, beholdeth whatsoe∣ver they do, he knoweth whatsoever they have don, and all things obey him. O ye that believe! honor and wor∣ship your Lord, and do good, perhaps, ye shall be blessed; Fight for the establishment of his Law with affection, he hath chosen you to follow it, he hath not given you a Law heavy and troublesom. It is the Law of <HI>Abraham</HI> your fa∣ther, he hath stiled you the Resigned to God; before the coming of the <HI>Alch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ran.</HI> The Prophet shall testifie a∣gainst

you at the day of judgment, and ye shal testifie a∣gainst the people, that the Prophet hath preached to them the right way; persevere in your prayers, pay tithes, &amp; trust in God, he is your Lord your Prophet and your protector.</P>

<P>I the Name of God, gracious and merifull. Certainly the True beleivers shall be blessed, that make their pra∣yers with humility; they abstain from reviling, they pay tithes, they commit not whoredom, they touch not other women, then their own, and their slaves, such as covet o∣ther, transgresse the bounds of reason; they that faithfully preserve what hath been intrusted to them, they that ef∣fect what they have promised, and that make their prayers at the time appointed, shall be heirs of Paradise, where they shall dwell eternally. We formed man of the dust of the earth, with mire blood congealed, with a little flesh and bones, which we invested with skin; we a∣nother time created him, when we breathed into him, the soul in the body, and blessed him, as one of our fairest or∣naments. O men! ye shall all dye, and shall rise again at the day of judgment; we created above you seven heavens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Gelal¦din.</NOTE> and have care of the conservation of al people that are be∣neath, we send water from heaven to satisfy your necessi∣ties; we make it to fall upon the earth, and have power to cause to passe away and deprive you [of it.] We have cre∣ated, &amp; made gardens to bring forth Date trees, Grapes &amp; many other fruits, by which ye live; we created trees in the mountain of <HI>Sinai,</HI> that produce oyl, and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or dying Colours.</NOTE> tincture; ye re∣ceive great advantage by beasts, they sustain you with milk, and afford you many other proffits, ye mount them, and ships also carry you whither ye desire to go. We sent <HI>Noah</HI> who spake to the people, and said, worship one God alone, what other God wil ye implore but him? Will ye not fear
<PB N="210" REF="118"/>
to worship another? The chief among the people that were idolaters, said to their adherents, this man is a man like your selvs, he would appear, and be esteemed more then you; if God would be adored alone, as he saith, he would cause an angel to descend, that should bring his Commandments; we have not heard spoken to our Predecessors, what he saith; he is a man possessed of the Devil, tarry, and ye shal see what will become of him. Then <HI>Noah</HI> said, Lord, protect me against them, and defend me from their blasphemies; we commanded him to build an Ark, when our command∣ment was given to destroy the wicked, and when the water of his caldron boyled, we commanded him to enter into the Ark, with two beasts of every kinde, and species; all men we destroyed, except them of whom we have before spoken, (we said unto him) speak not to me for Infidels, they shall be drowned, when thou shalt have taken order for every thing that must enter into the Ark, with thee, Say, praise be to God, who hath delivered us from the malice of the wicked, Lord, give us to descend in a blessed place, thou art the best Pilot in the world. It was a sign of my omnipotency to prove the people of <HI>Noah,</HI> we created after them another people, to whom we sent an Apostle, to instruct them to worship one God; and he said, what God will ye adore other then God? will ye not feare his wrath? Their Doctors that were impious, who denyed the Resurrection of the flesh, and on whom we had conferred the wealth of the Earth, said, he is a man, he eateth and and drinketh like you, if ye obey not a man like to your selves, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hall ye be destroyed? doth he promise you to return into the world, after having been bones and dust? O abuse! O abuse! ye are abused in what he promiseth, he is a man like other<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, he is a lyar, we will not beleive him. That a∣postle said, Lord, preserve me from their blasphemyes, they shal repeat suddenly of their impiety, then thunder surpri∣sed them, and destroyed them, as they deserved, we made the land dry &amp; barren without fruit, &amp; created other persons in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> place. Man cannot die before his hour, and none can retard it; we sent our Apostles, and our Prophets to in∣struct the peopl, but they were slain one after another, every
<PB N="211" REF="118"/>
Nation traduced the Prophet that we sent to them, and we made them serve for examples to posterity, and de∣stroyed the wicked. We sent <HI>Moses</HI> and his brother <HI>Aaron</HI> to <HI>Pharoah,</HI> and his Doctors, with our miracles, and with most intelligible reasons; they arose against the Faith, they tormented the children of <HI>Israel,</HI> and said, shall we believe in a man like to our selves, of them that obey us? They slandred both of them, and were in the num∣ber of the damned. We gave to <HI>Moses</HI> the Book of the Law, peradventure it wil guide the children of <HI>Israel</HI> into the right way; we created <HI>Jesus,</HI> &amp; <HI>Mary</HI> his mother, they are signs of our Unity; we established them in an eminent place, where they stayed neere a fountaine. O Apostles and Prophets! eat of the frurts of the earth, &amp; do good, I know whatsoever ye do, your Law is one law, &amp; I alone am your Lord; take heed to your selvs, follow not the law of the In∣fidels, every one liketh what he doth, depart frō the wicked &amp; leave them in their errors, an accompt shal be required of thē of the riches, &amp; of the children that we have given them but they know it not. Such as fear the punishment of their Lord, that obey his Commandements, profes his unity, give Alms of the substance that he hath given them, and feare in their hearts, that they are not acceptable to them, shall appear in his presence; such as shall obey him, shall en∣joy his grace; he requireth not of any man what he is un∣able to performe. We have a booke that declareth the truth, no injustice shall be done to him that shall doe what he is able; certainly the Infidels are in ignorance of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> they act what is quite contrary, to that which is commanded true believers; but we have punished the chief among them in their prosperity. Be not this day resolute, ye shall not be protected of us. Our Command∣ments are taught you, neverthelesse ye are returned upon your steps, and are risen against the Faith, and in discour∣sing by night, withdrew your selvs from the righteous. Con∣sider they not the words [of the <HI>Alcoran</HI>?] <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth it contain any thing that hath not bin ordained to their predecessors; know they not the Prophet that God hath sent to them? Wherefore will they not acknowledg him? Will they say
<PB N="212" REF="119"/>
that he is possessed of the devil? On the contrary, he reach∣eth them the truth, neverthelesse the greatest part of them detest him; if their will had place, heaven and earth, &amp; what∣soever is betwixt them should be confounded; we have in∣structed them in the Law which they ought to observe, but they have renounced it; Dost thou require of them any re∣compence for thy instructions? Thy Lord shall reward thee, there is none that is of power to recompence thee bet∣ter then He. Call them to the right way; such as shall not believe the Resurrection, shall err. If we pardon and de∣liver them from affliction, they will still continue in their errors, to their confusion; we heretofore chastised them, neverthelesse they humble not themselves, neither implo∣red their Lord; and when we opened upon them the gate of our Judgements, they became desperate. God hath given you sight, hearing, and sense, but few among you return him thanks, he it is that hath created you of earth, ye shall one day be assembled before him to be judged; he it is that gi∣veth life and death, and maketh the difference of day and night, will you not honor him, neither consider? On the contrary, they have said, as did their predecessors, wherefore shall we die? our bones shall be dust, and shall we rise a∣gain? This was heretofore promised to our fathers, and to us; certainly it is but an old song; Say unto them, to whom appertaineth the earth, and whatsoever is in the earth, if ye know [its Creator and King?] They will say, it is Gods; Say unto them, know ye not then, that he that created y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u can raise you again? who is Lord of the seven heavens? who possesseth the throne of heaven? they will say, it is God; say unto them, will ye not fear then to wor∣ship any other God but him? Say unto them, who is King of all things? who sustaineth them, and is sustained of none? They will say, that it is God; Say unto them, why then do ye deceive your selves? we have taught them the truth, but they have rejected it, and said, that God had a sonne; were there another God with God, the one would undoe what the other hath done, and they would rise the one against the other. Praised be God, what they affirm is not true, God knoweth that is past, the
<PB N="213" REF="119"/>
present, and the future, he hath no companion: Say, Lord, give me o see the effect of all that thou hast pro∣mised to them, and put me not among the unjust, deliver us from evill, and do good to us, I know their impiety; Lord deliver me from the temptations of the devill, deliver me from their malice; when any one among them dieth, he saith, Lord, permit me to return into the world, I will do better then I have done; there is no return, it is to speak in vain, there is an obstacle behinde them, that detaineth them untill the day of Judgment; when the Trumpet shall sound, nothing shall retard them, they shall not glo∣ry, nor discourse with each other: the ballance of the bles∣sed shall be heavy with good works, and the ballance of the cursed shal be light of good works. Have not my Command∣ments beene preached unto you, wherefore did ye con∣temn them? They shall say, Lord, our misery prevai∣led over us, we were mislead, Lord deliver us from this misery, the contrary was promised to us, truly we are ex∣ceedingly too blame. It shall be said unto them, depart into the fire, and never speak to come out. Many of them that worship me, say, Lord, we believe in thee, pardon our sins, thou art mercifull. Ye have derided them, O yee wicked! and have despised my Commandements, but I will reward them for their perseverance, and they shall be blessed. It shall be said to those that rise again, how many years have ye remained in the earth? they shall an∣swer, we have bin there a day, or some dayes, aske of the Angels appointed to keep the accompt, ye have bin there but a little time, did ye not know it, do you believe that I have created, and assembled you before me in vain? Praise and exalt God, King of Truth, there is no God but be, he is King of Heaven: he is void of reason that invoketh a∣nother God with Him, he shall give accompt of his actions, and the Infidells shall be miserable: Say, Lord, pardon the sins of the righteous, thou art the great mercifull.</P>

He that shall accuse an honest woman of adultery, shall be whipt with twenty four stripes, unlesse he prove his accusation by four witnesses, and shall never be credited in testimony. They that do such things, are without the obedience of God, except those that repent, and satisfie what they owe, God shall be to them gracious and mercifull. They that shall accuse their Wives of adultery, and have no witnesses, shall swear four times that they speak the truth, and shall the fifth time call for the curse of God to be upon them, if they be lyars. The Wife shall be exempt from punishment, if she swear four times that her husband is a lyar, and if the fifth time she pray that the wrath and indignation of God may be upon her,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Gelal∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</HI></NOTE> if what her husband hath said be true; In this manner doth God gratifie you, that ye may understand the truth, he is most gracious and most wise. That Troup that made defection from the True-believers with a lye, and false testimony, did you no harme; on the contrary, they did advantage you; every one shall bear the burden of his sinnes, the most m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>licious among them shall be thrown headlong into the torments of Hel;<NOTE PLACE="marg">This is <HI>Abdalla∣bin Selouk.</HI></NOTE> It was an happinesse that ye heard the sense of the believers from their own mouth, when the said,

Oh ye that are Tru-belie∣vers! follow not the footsteps of the Devill, he will en∣joyn you vice &amp; sin; had not God gratified you with his mercy, not any among you should have been purged from that imposture, but God purifieth whom he seeth good, he beareth all &amp; hnoweth all your intentions. The most rich and powerfull among you have not sworn to do no good to their parents, the poor, or to them that fight for the law of God, neverthelesse they do it not to them, and flie them; desire they not that God should pardon them? He is nei∣ther gentle nor pitifull but towards True-belivers. They that accuse of immodesty, women chast, innocent, and faithfull, shall be accursed in this world, and shall suffer great torments at the day; when their tongues, their hands and their feet shall testifie ageinst them; at the same time shall God pay to them what shall be due unto them with∣out injustice, and they shall know that God is truth it selfe.</P>
<P>The wicked women shall speak as the wicked men, and the wicked men as the wicked women: The good [wo∣men] shall speak as the good [men] and the good [men] as the good women; the good are innocent of the imposture of the wicked, they shall injoy the grace of God, and the treasures of Paradse.

<P>IN the name of God, gracious and merciful: praised be he that sent the <HI>Alcoran</HI> to his servant to instruct the world; he is King of the Heavens and Earth; he hath no Son, nor Companion in his rign; he created and ordai∣ned every thing. The Infidels worship Gods that can create nothing, and are things created; they can neither do them good nor evil, they can give neither life nor death, neither cause them to rise again. They say that the <HI>Alcoran</HI> is but a fable of thine invention, invented with the assistance of some other person; but they lye and blaspheme. They say that it is but an old Song, and a fable of the Ancients that thou writ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, and that thou stu∣diest morning and evening.

We said unto <HI>Moses,</HI> goe with <HI>Israel</HI> my servants, and fear not the people of <HI>Pharoah</HI> that shall follow thee: Pharoah sent his Commissioners through his Dominions to assemble the people, and said, (speaking of the children of Israell) those men are few in number, they have displeased me, but I will wel awake them. We moved Pharoah, and his people to depart out of Egypt, to pursue the children of Israel; we caused them to quit their gardens, fountaines, and houses of pleasure, and made the children of Israel heirs of their trea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure, they surprized them at the rising of the Sun; when the children of Israel beheld them, they said we are ov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>taken, Moses answered, no, my Lord is with me, he shall guide me, then we inspired Moses to strike the sea with his Rod, incontinently it divided it self on both sides, like two mountains; we saved him, and all that were with him, and drowned the men of Pharoah; which shall serve for an example to the incredulous and obsti∣nate, the Lord is omnipotent and mercifull.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVIII The Chapter of History, containing foure score and eight Verses, written at <HI>Mecca.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the Name of God, gracious and merciful. God is most pure, he understandeth all things, and is most wise. These mysteries are the mysteries of the Book that distin∣guisheth the truth from a lye. I relate to thee the history of Moses, and of Pharoah with truth, for the contentment of True-beleivers. Pharoah was powerfull on Earth, he en∣treated his Subjects as seemed good to him, he tormented ted one party, and murthered their Children, he abused their wives, and was of them that defiled the Earth. I gave my grace to thē that were afflicted on earth I made them successors of Pharoahs Kingdom, <HI>I</HI> established them in his Dominions; I made Pharoah, Haman, and their Army to see what they most feared; we said, to the mother of Moses, give suck to thy Child; if thou fearest that they will mischief him, cast him upon Nile, fear not, neither afflict thy self, I will restore him to thee between thine arms, and place him in the number of Prophets. The do∣mestiques of Pharoah found him upon the water, &amp; saved him, to be one day their enemy, &amp; to tormen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them, because Pharoah, Haman▪ and their people were Infidels. Pharo∣ahs wife said unto him, I entreat thee not to suffer this In∣fant to be slain, mine eyes rejoyce to see him, he shall one day be proffitable for our service as our Son, but they were ignorant of what should befall them; the heart of his mo∣ther was freed from fear, when she beheld him in the hands of Pharoah's wife, and scarce could she refrain to let them know that she was his mother; we caused her to have pa∣tience, and she had faith in our promises; She spa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to his sister to follow him step by step, she followed afar off, without intimation that she was his sister, or that she regar∣ded him. We had before prohibited Moses to suck the milk of any other nurse; then that of his mother; his sister
<PB N="238" REF="132"/>
said to <HI>Pharoahs</HI> servant, wil ye that I provide you a nurse, and people that shall carefully nourish him? We caused him to be restored to his mother, to nurse him; she ceased from her sadness, when she knew, and saw that God was sincere in what he had promised, but the greatest part of the people know it not. When <HI>Moses</HI> was aged, about thirty three years, we gave him knowledge and wisdom; thus do I reward the righteous; <HI>Moses</HI> entring one day into the City, met two men that fought; the one was of the Children of Israel, and the other was an Egyptian, and of his enemies, whom he assaulted, and slew; after this he said, the Devil tempted me, he is the open enemy of men; Lord, I have offended thee, pardon me; he pardoned him, he is gracious and mercifull; Lord, since thou hast bin so graci∣ous to me, I will never give aid or succour to Infidels. He continued in the City with fear, and kept himself upon his guard, on the mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow he again met him, whom the day before he had defended, who sought likewise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith another Egyptian, &amp; required his assistance; <HI>Moses</HI> said unto him, thou art seditious; he replyed, oh <HI>Moses</HI>! wilt thou slay me, as thou didst slay him yesterday? Wilt thou be a mur∣therer of all men, or a just man? Not long after a man came [in hast] to him from the utmost part of the City, who said unto him, oh <HI>Moses</HI>! the Officers of <HI>Pharoah</HI> have conspired against thee, they desire to put thee to death; save thy self, and follow my councell: He departed from the City with fear, keeping himself upon his guard, beseeching his Lord to deliver him from the hands of In∣fidels; he went towards <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adian,</HI> and said, Lord suffer me not to folow an evil way, he met a great number of persons that made their flocks to drink, he with them found 2 maids that could not water their Cattel, he said unto them what do ye two here? VVe have not strength to draw water to give our beasts to drink, we tarry for the Shepheard, our father is too old to draw [it] He drew water out of the well to water their Cattell, and withdrew to a shade, because of the heat of the Sunne, saying Lord, I am deprived of all the graces which heretofore then didst confer on me, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m now poor and nec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>us. One of
<PB N="239" REF="132"/>
those maidens came to seek him, &amp; bashfully said unto him, my father calleth thee, to recompence thee for the pains thou hast taken in watering our catle; when he was in the old mans presence, he related what had befaln him. The old man said, fear nothing, I wil deliver thee from the hands of the wicked; one of his daughters said to her sister, give to this man to eat, &amp; reward his pains, he assisted us with affection; their father said unto him, I wil marry thee to one of my two daughters, on conditi∣on, that thou wilt have a care of my flocks the space of eight years; ten years if it please thee, said <HI>Moses</HI>; I will not forsake thee, thou shalt find me an honest man, <HI>I</HI> wil serve thee the two terms, either 8. or 10. yeares, as shall seem good to thee, God is witnesse of what I say. After the term expired, <HI>Moses</HI> forsook the house of his father in law, withdrawing with his wife, he beheld affar off a great fire on the side of the mountain, and said to his Wife, tarry here, I see the fire of the omnipotent, I will speedily return, I will bring you a spark, peradventure you shall be warmed; when he drew near to this fire, they cryed unto him from the right side of the valley, from an eminent place, and from a bush O <HI>Moses</HI>! I am God, Lord of the Universe, cast thy staffe on the ground; when he beheld his staffe to move, as it had bin alive, he fled for fear, and returned no more: O <HI>Moses!</HI> draw near, and fear not, thou art in a place of safety, put t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine hand into thy pocket, it shall come out white &amp; shining, without harm; draw back thine arm into thy sleeve, it shall return to its former condition, thy staffe and thine hand shall be two signs of my Omnipotency to <HI>Pharoah</HI> and his Ministers, who disobey my Commandments, <HI>Moses</HI> said, Lord, I have s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain an <HI>Egyptian,</HI> I am afraid they will take away my life, command <HI>Aaron</HI> who is elo∣quent, to go with me, to aid me, &amp; to confirm what I shal say, I f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar they wil traduce me: I wil give thee thy Brother for thy assistant, I wil give to you both strength to de¦fend your selvs from their malice; go, do what is comman∣ded you, ye shall be victorious, and all those that shal follow you: when <HI>Moses</HI> came to <HI>Pharoah,</HI> he made

They shall finde none to protect them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the day of Judgment; we cursed them on earth, and at the day of the Resurrection they shall be abominable to all the world.

When they heard the faith evill spoken of, they withdrew themselves, took leave of the company, and said, ye shall answer for your and we for our actions. Regard not the ignorant, thou shalt not convert all them that thou shalt desire to convert; God converteth, and guideth into the right way whom he pleaseth, and knoweth such as serve him.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX. The Chapter of the Spider, containing sixty nine verses written at <HI>Mecca.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the name of God, gracious and merciful: I am God most wise. Men have beleived that it is sufficient to say we beleive in God, and that they be not proved: Cer∣tainly God proved their predecessors, and knew such as were zealous in his Law, and them that were Infidels. Do they who have done evill, think to escape the punishment of their crimes, and not to be judged? Such as hope to see God, shall behold him at the time appointed by his divine Majesty; he understandeth and knoweth all things. He that fighteth for the faith, fighteth for his soule; certainly God hath no need of men, their sins shall be pardoned who shall beleive in his divine Majesty, and shall do good works. We enjoyned the children of Israel to honour their father and mother, and to do good to them; if they press thee to worship many Gods, thou shalt be damned, if thou give ear to them, obey them not in this matter, ye shall be assembled before me, I will set before you all that ye have done, I will reward you accor∣ding to your works, and place such as shall have observed my Law in the number of the blessed. There be men who affirm, that they beleive in God, and are impatient when evill befalleth them from God to prove them. If God give victory to the True beleivers, they say, that they are on their side, but doth not God know what is in their heart? he knoweth them that beleive in his Law, and those that are impious. The Infidels, said to the True-beleivers, do like us, follow our way, we will bear your sins; They will not bear them, they are lyars, they shal bear their own bur∣then; shal not an accompt of their sins be required of them at the day of Judgment? We sent <HI>Noah</HI> to instruct men, he lived upon the earth 900. &amp; 50. years. The flood sur∣prized, &amp; destroyed the people of his time, because they
<PB N="245" REF="135"/>
were unjust, and we saved <HI>Noah</HI> and those that were with him in the Ark; this ought to serve for example to all the world. Remember <HI>Abraham,</HI> who said to his people, adore one God, and fear him, ye shall do well, if ye have know∣ledge to comprehend it; ye worship but Idols, &amp; are but lyars, those whom ye worship cannot benefit you; im∣plore succor of God, worship him, and give him thanks for his graces, ye shall one day appear before him, if ye traduce me, those that were before you traduced the pro∣phet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Gods Messengers: Messengers are obliged only to discharge their message; are ye ignorant that God causeth men to dye, and shall raise them again? it is a thing easie to God: Walk through the earth, and consi∣der how God hath extirpated your predecessors, &amp; crea∣ted after them another people, certainly he is omnipo∣tent. He punisheth and pardoneth as he seeth goed, yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall one day be assembled before him to be judged; you shall not render him impotent, either in the Earth, or in the heavens, ye shall find none of power to protect, or defend you against his divine Majesty; such as obey not his Commandments, who beleive not the resurrection, and despair of his mercy, shall suffer great torments; the people answered, kill Abraham, and burn him; but God delivered him from the fire that they had kindled, which shall serve for example to True-beleivers. He said unto them, ye adore only <HI>Idols,</HI> because of your love to the wealth of the world; ye shall despise and curse each o∣ther at the day of judgement. Hel shall be your habita∣tation and ye shall be deprived of protection. Lot belei∣ved in his words, and said, <HI>I</HI> wil retyre <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the place which my Lord shal appoint me▪ he alone îs omnipo∣tent and most wise.

Let us see the Judgements of God, if what tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> speakest be true. Then he said, Lord protect me against unbelievers. When our Messengers came towards <HI>Abra∣ham,</HI> to declare to him that he should have children; they said unto him, We will ruine <HI>Lots</HI> City, and destroy all the inhabitants thereof, because they are impious. <HI>Abraham</HI> answered, <HI>Lot</HI> dwelleth in that City; they said, We know all that is within it, and we will preserve him, with all his fa∣mily, except his wife, she shall be in the number of them that shall be punished. When our Messengers arrived at <HI>Lots</HI> house, he was troubled, in that he had not strength sufficient to defend them from the malice of the people; they said unto him, fear nothing, neither afflict thy selfe. We will preserve thee and all thy family, except thy wife; she shall abide among them that shall be destroyed; we wil cause t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e indignation of God to fall upon this City, be∣cause of their impiety; it shal serve for exampl to posterity We sent <HI>Chaib</HI> to his brethren, the inhabitants of <HI>Madi∣an</HI>; he said unto them, Worship one God, fear the day of Judgment, and defile not the Earth.

We destroyed <HI>Caron, Pharaoh,</HI> and <HI>Haman; Moses</HI> preached to them my Commandments; they contemned them, and became proud in the Earth, but escaped not the punishment of their crimes. We chastised some by an impetuous wind, and other were surprized by thunder; we deprived them of their riches, and they were drowned. God was not unjust towards them, they drew mischiefe on themselves through their impiety. They that worship Id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls are like to the Spider; she buildeth her house of her cob-wed, that cannot defend from heat or cold. They would not adore Idols, did they understand what they do; God seeth what they worship, he is omnipotent and wise. I teach the people these parables, and none but the wise understand them.

Instruct them in the Book that is inspired i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to thee; make thy pray∣ers at the time appointed, prayers divert men from sin; to be mindful of God is the best work thou canst perform, he knoweth al the actions of men.

They have said, we will not beleive in this Book, unles God work in it some miracle. Say unto them, Miracles proceed from God, <HI>I</HI> am sent only to preach the torments of Hell. Is it not sufficient, that we have sent thee the <HI>Alcoran</HI> to instruct them? it containeth the effects of my mercy &amp; precepts, necessary for their salvatiō. Say unto them, it suficeth that God is witnesse of mine actions, betwixt you and me; he knoweth whatsoever is in heaven; and in Earth: they that beleive in Idols, and have not faith in God, are damned. They urge thee to make them see the punishment of their crimes; if the time were come, they should soone feel it; they shall rescent it, when they least think of it, but they know it not; they shall presse thee to make them see it.

<P>IN the name of God, gracious &amp; merciful. I am the most wise God.

God disposeth all things from the be∣ginning to the end; When they shall be victorious, the

True-beleivers shall rejoyce in the victory that God shall give them; he protecteth whom to him seemeth good; he is omnipotent and merciful. He hath promised them victory, and departeth not from his promises; of which the greatest part of men are ignorant; they affect the life of this world, and consider not their end: Will they not consider that God hath created the heavens and the earth, and all that is in them? and hath appointed to every thing a limited and prefixed time? Certainly the greatest part of the people believe not in the Resurrection: Will they not consider the end of their predecessors, who were more powerfull and wealthy then they? God hath sent to all an Apostle to teach them his Law, he hath don to them no injustice, they have drawn mischief on themselves through their iniquity; the end of the wicked shall be like to their works, they des∣pise the Commandments of God, &amp; deride them, but God shall cause them to die, and rise again, and all shall be assem∣bled before him at the day of Judgement; that day shall they be desperate, their Idols shall not intercede for them, they shall forsake them, and they shall be separated from the true-believers. Such as believe in God, and do good works shall enjoy the delights of Paradise, and the wicked shall be chastised according to their demerits. Praise God, pray un∣to him evening and morning, praise is due to him in heaven and earth; pray unto him before the Sun set, and at the hour of noon▪ he maketh the dead to come out of the living, and the living out of the dead; he causeth the barren earth to re∣vive, and grow green after its death; in like manner will he cause you to arise again, and come out of your sepulchers: it is a sign of his omnipotency, to have created you of earth▪ to have given you flesh and bones, and to have created the woman (of the rib of the man) to dwell with him; he hath commanded you to love mutually, and to exercise charity among you, these things are signs of his omnipotency to them that consider his graces. The creation of heaven and earth, the diversity of tongues, the differences of your visages, and of your colour, the night created for repose, and the day for travell, the lightning that terrifieth the people, and which through rain causeth the earth a∣gain

He spea∣keth to you in a parable, drawn from your selves, your slaves; are they your companions? do they equally partake with you in the goods which God hath given you?

It is a sign of his Omnipotency, to send the winds to bring you rain, and make you to taste the fruits of his grace; the ship runneth upon the water through his permission, for the advantage of your commerce; will ye not be thankfull to him for his benefits?

Remember thou that <HI>Locman</HI> said unto his son, O my son! beleive not thou that God hath a companion, it is an exceeding great sin: we have commanded man to honour his father and mother; his mother beareth him with greif upon grief &amp; weaneth him at the age of two years; be thou not ingrateful for Gods benefits, honor father &amp; mother, thou shalt be one day before God to be Judged. If thy parents press thee to beleive that God hath companions, obey them not, follow the way of them that obey him, all men shall be one day assembled before him, to be rewarded according to their works. O my son! if thou dost evil, of the weight of a grain of Mustardseed, or of the weight of a rock, or of the greatnesse of heaven and earth; God wil know it, and put it in accompt, he is exact and omniscient. O my son! make thy prayers at the time appointed, do what is honest and civill, fly what is not approved, and be patient in thy ad∣versities; regard not the world, disordred through pride; converse not with the proud, God detesteth the haughty; observe thy steps, walk with modesty, speak gently, they be persons that bray like Asses when they speak: seest thou not that God hath created for men all that is in heaven and earth, and conferreth on them his graces in generall, and particular. There be ignorant [persons] that dispute of the Diety without reason; when it is said unto them, do what God hath appointed, they answer, we will do what we saw don by our fathers.

On the contrary, it is the truth it self, which pro∣ceedeth from thy Lord, to preach to them that heretofore had none to instruct them; peradventure they will follow the right way. God created heaven and earth, and all that is between them, in six dayes, and sitteth on his Throne; who shall protect you? who shall hear your prayers but he? will you never consider it? He disposeth all things in heaven and earth, all men shall one day be assembled before him to be judged; a thousand years are but one day before his divine Majesty; he knoweth what is past, present, and fu∣ture, he is omnipotent &amp; merciful, he hath created every thing for his people, he formed man of the dirt, and dust of the earth, he inspired the soul into his body, he giveth you hearing, sight, &amp; sense, but few men return him thanks for his graces; they say, what, shall we die, and return to be a new people? Certainly they beleive not in the Resur∣rection. Say unto them, the Angel of death shall cause you to dye, and ye shall return before God to be judged. Thou shalt then see how the Infidel will hang downe the head before their Lord, and say, Lord, we now see the cer∣tainty of the Resurrection; we this day know the truth of thy words, permit us to reurn into the world, we will be righteous, we now understand what is profitable &amp; nece∣ssary for us, we could have given a guide to every person, my word is most true, <HI>I</HI> will fill hell with the wicked, &amp; Paradise with the righteous; thus shal men be rewarded &amp; chastised according to their works.

Such as believe in the mysteries of my Law are humble, they worship me alone, &amp; praise me when they here mention of me; they are not proud, rebell not against my Commandments: they arise from their bed to make their prayers with fear and hope, and imploy in pious works some part of the wealth that we have given them. No man hath either seen or knoweth what God reserveth to recom∣pence the righteous for their perseverance.

The Prophet is obeyed of them that believe in God, and honour his wives, as their Mothers. Kinsmen are heirs of each other, it is so appointed by his divine Majesty to the Believers that went out of <HI>Mecca</HI> to follow the Prophet: It is ordained in Scripture to do good to your parents. Remember thou that we received the promise of the Prophets of thee, of <HI>Noah,</HI> of <HI>Abraham,</HI> of <HI>Moses,</HI> and of Jesus the Sonne of <HI>Mary,</HI> (to worship but one God) we received a strong pro∣mise: An accompt shall be required of their actions, and the wicked shall feel the rigour of infinite paines. Oh ye that believe in God! remember his favour towards you; when ye were charged by troups of Enemies, he sent against them an impetuous winde, and troups invisible to your eyes, to fight them, he seeth all that ye do; those invisible troups came from the East, and from the West, from a∣bove, and below, when your sight was troubled, and your hearts failed you, because of the great number

of your Enemies; ye had already conceived a very bad opi∣nion of the Law of <HI>God</HI>; then were the True-believes tri∣ed, they trembled with fear; The wicked, and such as were weak in their faith, said, that whatsoever <HI>God</HI> and his Pro∣phet had promised them, was but abuse &amp; vanity; Remem∣ber thou how a party of them said to the Inhabitants of the Territory of <HI>Medina,</HI> there is no safety for you with <HI>Mahomet,</HI> return into your houses: Remember thou how many among them required dismission, and said, that their houses were forsaken: Their houses were not forsaken, but they had a design to flye; had they returned to their hou∣ses, they had on all sides perswaded them to follow impie∣ty, they should not there have made long abode, because the before had promised <HI>God</HI> not to fly; he would have requi∣red an accompt of their promises.

Say unto them, who is able to protect you against <HI>GOD,</HI> when he shall resolve to destroy you? take none other pro∣tector but him; he knoweth them that were disswaded to go to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell to spare their Wealth and Persons.

Such men believe not in God, he rendreth all their works unfruitfull, it is a thing ea∣sie to his divine Majesty. The Troups of the Infidels be∣lieved they were invincible, and when they saw the troups of the True believers, they desired to flye. The Infidels desired to draw the <HI>Arabians</HI> to their party, and have intel∣ligence to know in what condition you are; had they bin of your party, few of them had bin slain; the adhering to the Prophet of God serveth to you as a Cittadell, it serveth as a Bulwark to them that apprehend the day of Judg∣ment, and think often on his divine Majesty. When the believers said, behold! what God and his Pro∣phet promised us, they are sincere in their promi∣ses; the sight of their enemies encreased their faith, and zeale towards God and his Prophet. There be persons among
<PB N="259" REF="142"/>
the True-believers who have performed what they promi∣sed to God; many of them are dead in obedience to the Commandments of his divine Majesty, others attend the same thing, &amp; swarve not from w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at they have promised; God shall recompense them for their zeal, and chastise the Infidels, or pardon them if it so please him, he is gracious and merciful. God shall destroy the unbelievers with their wrath against the believers; he protecteth True-believers incombats, he is strong and omnipotent. The Iews de∣scended from their Fortress, to give aid to the Infidels, but God cast fear into their hearts; a party of them were slain, and the rest taken slaves; they by their death made you heirs of their lands, their houses, their riches, and fortresses which you were not able to conquer; God is omnipotent. Oh Prophet! if thy wives be too ambitious of the wealth of the earth, and of garments too sumptuous; Call them, Say unto them, that thou wilt deal well with them, &amp; wilt repudiate them wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h mildnesse and civility. If they love God and his Prophet, if they are vertuous, his divine Ma∣jesty will give them an exceeding great reward: Oh ye wives of the Prophet! such of you as shall be unchaste, shall be punished doubtly more then other women, this is a thing easie to God; such among you as shall obey God and his Prophet, and shall do good works, shall be rewar∣ded more then other women, an exceeding great reward is prepared for you. Oh ye wives of the Prophet! ye are not like other women of the world; fear God, and believe not in the discourse of such as have design to seduce you, speak with civility, abide in your houses; go not forth to make your beauty appear, and to make a shew, as did the ignorant of old; pray to God with affection, give almes, obey God and his Prophet, God will deliver you from his wrath, and will purifie you: be mindful of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aw that is taught you in your houses, he is mercifull to them that honour him, he knoweth all the actions of the Prophet, he hath promised his mercy, and an excee∣ding great reward to those (Men and Women) that shall obey his Commandments.

They that understand the Scripture, know that God hath taught thee the very truth, to guide the people into the right way, into the path of honour and vertue; but the wicked said among them, will ye beleive a man, who affirmeth, that after your death ye shall rise again, and be new creatures? he lyeth impu∣dently, he is possessed of the devill.

Consider they not the heaven and the earth? If I will, I can render it barren, and cause a peice of the heaven to fall upon them for a signe of my Omnipotency. We gave our grace to <HI>David,</HI> and spake to the mountains, birds, and mettals with him, to praise me; we commanded him to make cuirasses, &amp; Iron was soft in his hand, as wax.

The devill caused them to believe his opinion, they followed him, ex∣cept some of the true believers that were among them; he had no power over them, but to know them that be∣lieved in the Resurrection, and such as doubt. Thy Lord observeth and regardeth all. Say unto them, invoke your Idols, they have not power of the bigness of an Atome, neither in heaven, nor earth, God hath no companion, they shall find none to protect them at the day of Iudgment,

none shall intercede for them without the permission of his divine Majesty; if they receive any relaxation in their fear, they enquire of each other what God spake, &amp; answer, that he spake the truth; that he is most high, and most migh∣ty; Say unto them, who enricheth you with the good things of heaven and earth? they will say that it is God. Say unto them, who of you, or of us followeth the right way? Or who of you, or of us is seduced? Enquire not after our sins, we are not curious to know what ye do, God shall assemble us at the day of Judgment, and shall judge our dif∣ferences with equity, he i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an exceeding great Judge; say unto them, let us see the Idols that ye have worshiped; cer∣tainly there is but one God, omnipotent and wise.

The chief Inhabitants of the Cities, said to the Prophets that we sent to them to preach the torments of hell, that they believe not their words. We have (said they) more riches, and more children then those that believe in their discourse, we shall not be damned, as they affirm; Say unto them, my Lord giveth and taketh away riches as seemeth good to him, but the greatest part of the people know it not; your wealth and your children

They said, when thou didst preach unto them our Commandments, this man would hinder us to worship the gods of our fathers, he is a blas∣phemer. They have said, that the <HI>Alcoran</HI>▪ is but Sorcery and Magick, and reade not the books that we have sent unto them.

Say unto them, God teacheth his Prophets the truth, and what is to come; the truth appeared, &amp; falshood was discovered, and the lyars were deprived of his mercy; if I wilfully go astray, or if I act what God hath enjoyned me, this shall be for my soul: God heareth, and is present at all things.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXV. The Chapter of the Creator, containing fourty and five Verses, written at <HI>Mecca.</HI></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>This Chapter it intituled the Chapter of Angels, in the Book</HI> Tefsir and Ioahir, <HI>which treateth of the exposition of the</HI> Alcoran <HI>in Turkish.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. Praise be to God, Creator of Heaven and Earth, who created the Angels, the Messengers of his Commandments; they have wings, two, three, and foure; he maketh of his Creature what seemeth good to him, he is om∣nipotent; none can comprehend the grace that he hath given to his people, it is incomprehensible, he is omnipo∣tent and most wise. Oh people! Remember the grace of God, is there a Creator beside him? he enrich∣eth you with the riches of Heaven and Earth, there is no God beside him. How can the wicked blaspheme against his divine Majesty? If they traduce thee, certainly they traduced the Prophets that were sent before thee, they shall be one day assembled before God to be judged. Oh ye people! what God hath promised is infallible; glory not in the wealth of the Earth, beware least the Devill se∣duce you, and render you proud; because that God doth a while defer the punishment of your crimes. The Devill is your enemy, be ye his enemies, he leadeth them that follow him into the fire of Hell, where they shall suffer the rigors of infinite paines; their sinnes shall be remitted that believe in God, and do good works: Oftentimes, he that delighted in what he doth, belie∣veth
<PB N="268" REF="147"/>
he doth well; God misleadeth and guideth whom it pleaseth him; be not unwilling to depart from the wicked, God knoweth all their actions. He sendeth the winds that drive the clouds unto barren and dry places, to refresh the Earth, and cause it to revive after its death; in like man∣ner will he raise again the dead. He that affecteth great∣ness, shall finde in God all manner of greatnesse; good speeches ascend even to his divine Majesty, and our good works are acceptable to him. Such as conspire against the Prophet, shall endure great torments, and their conspi∣racy become vain and unprofitable. God hath created you of dust and mire, be created▪ you men and women; the wo∣man neither conceiveth, not bringeth forth, but through his permission; no man can either prolong or shorten his life, but following what is written in the book [kept in heaven] these things are easie to God. Those two Seas are not like to <HI>Eaphrates,</HI> whose water is sweet and pleasant to drinke; the water of the Sea is cold, and salt, neverthelesse ye eat of the fish of the one, and the other; Ye fish out of the Sea, gemmes, to adorne you; you see the Ship to run upon the waters, and cleave the waves, for the advantage of your commerce, peradventure you will return thanks to God for his graces. He causeth the night to enter into the day, and the day into the night; he created the Sunne and the Moon, that run in the Heaven till the day appointed. That God who created these things, is your Lord, the em∣pire of the world is his; the Idols that ye worship have no more power then the skin of an <HI>Almand</HI>; if ye invoke them they shall not hear you, they shall deny you at the day of Iudgment, and are not of power to let you know either the joyes of Paradise, or the torments of Hell. Oh ye people! ye are poor and necessitous, ye have need of Gods assist∣ance, and God hath no want of you; prayse is due to him in every place; he will destroy you, if it seeme good to him, and create another new people in your place; none shall bear the burthen of another, be it never so light or heavy, no, not when they are neer of Kin. Preach thou the torments of Hell to such as feare their Lord, without seeing him and make their pray∣ers
<PB N="269" REF="147"/>
at the time appointed. He that taketh heed of offen∣ding him, laboureth for himself; all the world shall be one day assembled before him to be judged; The blind are not like to such as see clear; darkness is not like to light, the shade and coolnesse are not like to the heat of the Sun; the living are not like the dead; God causeth himself to be understood of whom he pleaseth, thou canst not make the Commandments of God to be understood by them that are in their Sepulchers; we have sent only to preach the pains of Hell, and the joyes of Paradise, there is no place in the world where they have not been preached; If the Jn∣fidels traduce thee, their predecessors likewise traduced them whom we sent heretofore, to preach to them the mysteries of faith, and the scriptures; they were surprizd in their sins, were rigorously chastised. Seest thou not how thy Lord caused rain to fall from Heaven, to make the Earth pro∣duce many fruits of sundry sorts, and to nourish in the Mountains the Goats, the Stags, and Hinds? to nourish the Crowes and Ravens, the men, and beasts of divers kinds and forme? God gratifieth his creatures that acknowledge his benifits, he is omnipotent and mercifull. They who d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>voutly read the book of God, who make their prayers at the time appointed, and bestow in pious works, secretly or publiquely, part of the wealth that we have given them, have hope of a recompence that shall never perish; God shall recompense and augment his Graces upon them, he is mercifull towards the good, and accepteth the ac∣knowledgment of his graces. The Book that we have sent thee containeth the truth, it confirmeth the anci∣ent Scriptures, <HI>GOD</HI> knoweth and seeth all things. We have given the understanding, of the <HI>Alcora<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> to such as We have chosen among our creature; there be some who have ill discharged what we taught them; some have performed what was enjoyned them, and others have taught it with affection and diligence through Gods permission. This is a great grace, they shall enter into the garden of <HI>Eden,</HI> where they shall remain eternaly; they shall be adorned with collars of gold, enrichede with precious stones, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="270" REF="148"/>
shall be cloathed with fine silk, &amp; shall say, praised be God, who hath delivered us from affliction, he is most merciful, and accepteth the thanks of his creatures; such as through his speciall grace shall enjoy the house of eternity, shall be free from all pain, and the Infidels shall be cast head∣long into the fire of Hell. They shall not dye in those tor∣ments, and their torture shall neve be asswaged; thus shall the wicked be chastised, they shall in vain implore succor of God, and say, Lord deliver us from these paines, we will do better then we have done heretofore I will no more prolong your life on Earth, I have sent you my pro∣phets and Apostles, They preached unto you my Com∣mandments, you would not hear them, taste now the pains of Hell, which ye have merited, the wicked shall this day be deprived of protection. Certainly God knoweth what∣soever is in Heaven and Earth, he knoweth all that is in the hearts of men He it is that hath made you to multiply on earth, impiety shall rise against the impious, it shall render them abominable before God, and put them into the number of the damned; Say unto them, have ye well considered the Idols that ye have worshipped? Tell me, what have they created on Earth? Were they Gods com∣panions in the Creation of the Heavens? Hath God sent to them a Book, and reasons, to authorize their impiety? Certainly the wicked instruct one another only in pride and arrogancy; God sustaineth the Heavens and the Earth, he alone is able to sustain them, he is gracious and merciful. The wicked swore to fight for the encrease of the faith, if there should come to them a Preacher to instruct them; and when he came, they augmented their wickednes, became proud in the earth, &amp; conspired against the True-deleivers; their conspiracy fell upon themselves, and they can expect none other things then what was ordained a∣gainst their predecessors, the law of God admitteth none al∣teration.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. Oh man! I swear by the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> ful of Doctrine, that thou art a pro∣phet, sent to teach the People the right way. This book was sent by the Omnipotent and mercifull; that thou mayst in∣struct men in that which was not taught their predecessors; Certainly, what was said is true, <HI>viz.</HI> That the greatest part of them is incredulous; we will put a chain upon their neck, and bind their hands to the very chin; they shall lift up the head to complain, but we will place before &amp; behind them great obstacle, we will cover their sight with darknes, &amp; they shall not see a jot. Misery is upon them; whether thou dost reprove, or not reprove them, they shall not be converted. If thou preachest to them that belive in the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and to such as beleive in what they have seen, proclaim to them a generall pardon of their sinnes, and a very great reward.

his Prophets; we sent into them two Prophets, they slan∣dered both of them; we succored them by a third; they all three said to the Inhabitants of this City, we are sent from God to preach to you his Commandments. They answered, ye are but men like us, God hath not sent us a sign to make you known, ye are lyars. They said, cer∣tainly God knoweth that he sent us to you; we are obliged only to preach to you his Commandments; They answe∣red, would ye make us Infidels like your selves? If ye end not this discourse, we will stone you, and make you to suf∣fer heavy torments. They said, be your evill with you, who hath heretofore so ill instructed you? Certainly you are wick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d; Then a man came running from the utmost part of the City, who said unto them, oh people! obey the Apostles of God, obey them that require no reward from you for the pains which they take in teaching you, and who are in the right way. Wherefore shall not I worship him that created me, and before whom ye all shall be as∣sembled to be judged? Will ye worship another beside him? If it be his will to chastise me, your Idols cannot save me, I should be extremely erroneous, should I believe in your God; hear and understnnd what I say unto you. [Neverthelesse they sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m] and said unto him, go, enter into Paradice; He said, in dying, would to God this people knew the graces that his divine Majesty hath conferred on me, he placed me in the number of the blessed; After his death we did not send Angels from Heaven to chastise the wicked; I will send them but once to destroy them; they shall one day be dumb, for shame that they have not followed the True believers, and of, being mocked by them that I sent to preach unto them my Command∣ments; Will they not consider how much people we have destroyed in times past, who are not returned, and that shall be one day assembled before me to be judged? The Earth, drie, dead, and barren, as a sign of my omnipotency for the wicked; we made it revive, and became green again, and to bring forth fruits, with wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch they were satiate; we there created Gardens, Date-trees, and Vines, we cau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Fountains to flow; they eat of the fruits
<PB N="273" REF="149"/>
which are not the works of their hands; will they not acknowledg the works of their Lord? Praise is due to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m that created the male and the female of all plants that the Earth produceth, who created man and woman, and many other things, of which they have no knowledg. It is a sign of my omnipotency, to seperate the day from the night, &amp; to make the Sunne to run to his appointed place. We have appointed to the Moon her signes, she goeth and commeth alwayes through her old way; the Sun neither hasteneth, nor retardeth his course at any time, neither doth joyn himself by night to the Moon; the night com∣eth not untill the end of the day. And all, to wit, the Moon, the Sun, and the Stars exalt my glory in the Heaven: it is a mark of mine omnipotency, to have born their Fathers upon the waters in the Ark, and to have given them vessels like the Ark to bear them; had it plea∣sed me, I had caused them to be drowned, without succor and salvation; I saved them through my special grace, until the time appointed. The wicked despise the signs of Gods omnipotency, and scoffed, when they were requi∣red to fear the wrath of his divine Majesty, present, and to come, and that their iniquities shall be forgiven them. When it was said unto them, give almes of the wealth that God hath given you, they answered, shall I give him to eat to whom God shall give bread when it shall please him? They are in a very great error. They will enquire of you when the day of Judgement shall be; and if ye be∣leive it, tel them that they must expect but one sole voice, that shall surprise them, they shall quarrell, they shall not be able to make their Testament, neither return to see their parents; in the end they shall go out of their Sepul∣che<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and present themselves before God, when the Trum∣pet shall sound; Then shal they say, we are most miserable, to have departed from our graves, behold what God hath promised us! The Prophets spake to us the Truth, <HI>viz.</HI> That the world ought to expect but one voice; This day shall all men be assembled before their Lord, no in∣justice shall be done to any person, and every one shall be rewarded, &amp; chastised after his works: Such as shall go
<PB N="274" REF="150"/>
into Paradise, shall be in exceeding great repose, with al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> manner of contentment, they and their wives shall be safe from all evills, lying on delicious beds, they shall have all sorts of fruits, and whatsoever they shall desire, they shall be saluted on the behalf of the Lord, gracious and merci∣full. God shall say to the wicked at the day of Judgment, Depart yee this day from the company of the good; did I not forbid you to worship the Devill, your open enemy, but to worship me alone, and that it was the right way? Did I not tell you that the Devill seduced a multitude of the people? Ye would not beleive it, behold Hell, that is pre∣pared for you, through your incredulity. I will shut their mouth, their hand shall speak, and their feet shall be wit∣nesses of their crimes; If we wil, we can make the Infidels blind, they shall find no way, they shall not be able to go or come, and shall be succored of none; had it been our pleasure we could have transformed them in their houses, and they had not been able to go forth; I will cast their head against the ground, and will render them infamous, whose life I shall prolong, and they shall not know their er∣rors. We have not made them to understand the mysteries of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> but that was not necessary; it is but to preach to the living, who comprehend what is spoken to them; it is most true, that the wicked shall be punished: See they not that we alone have created all the beasts of the earth, over which they command? We have made them subject to them; Some serve them to ride on, and others for their nourishment; will they be ingratfull? Neverthelesse they have worshipped Idols, they adored what could not de∣liver them from the pains of Hell. Afflict not thy selfe at their discourse. I know whatsoever they say, and all that they keep secret in their souls; Doth not man consider that we created him of dust? And that he is to arogant? God hath taught us how he formed his Creatures, never∣thelesse the wicked have said, who is he that can give life to bones that are rotten?

Wee adorned the Heaven and the Earth with Planets, and have kept them safe from the ma∣lice of the Devills; they cannot hear what is spoken in the Firmament, they are shamefully driven away on all sides, and shall be eternally tormented; if they heare any thing spoken, they heare it greedily, and follow [it] speedily, but the shining Planet persueth them, [and detecteth their malice.] The wicked have demanded if wee created any thing more illustrious then they; Certainely wee created them all of the dust of the Earth: Thou art amazed at their blasphemies, they deride thy amazement, and shall never be converted. When they shall see miracles, they shall scoffe, and say, that it is but evident magick to believe that they shall dye, and after, being earth, bones, and dust, they shall rise againe with their Fathers and predecessors: Say unto them, that they shall rise againe, and that they ere seduced from the right way; that the world shall be but once destroyed, and they shall see what will befall them at the day of Judgment: They shall that day say, they are wretched, and the Angel shall say unto them, behold the day of Judgment, behold the day that the Godly shall be separated

Consider ye not that he is God alone, without children? have ye any reason or authority to speak in this maner? bring your arguments, produce your reason, if ye are true.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. I swear by the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> that this Book teacheth the way of Salvation; neverthelesse, the Infidels resist the Faith, and are among themselves of a different opinion. How many have we de∣stroyed in times past, that were like unto them? They cry∣ed, and required succors, but they were no longer to be succored. The Infidels wonder, that a man like them∣selves should be sent to instruct them; they say, That he is a Magician, and a lyar, to preach one sole God. It is a strange thing! Their Doctors forsook their Assemblies, they went to preach through the City, and said, Persist to adore your Gods; we abjure the beliefe of the vnity of God, the last Sect did not preach it; it is an evident lie. Was <HI>Maho∣met</HI> chosen among us to receive alone the <HI>Alcoran</HI> descen∣ded from Heaven? Certainly they doubt the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> they shall know the truth, when they shall be in the fire of Hell. Have they in their power the Treasures of the mercy of thy Lord, omnipotent and bountifull? Possesse they the King∣dom of the Heavens and Earth, and whatsoever is betwixt them? If it be so, let them ascend into Heaven with their forces; assuredly, they shall be shamefully beaten in all places. The wicked heretofore defamed <HI>Noah, A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, Pha∣roah,</HI> the maker of <HI>Charmes,</HI> and <HI>Temod,</HI> the Inha∣bitants of the City of <HI>Lot</HI>; those that dwelt in the Fo∣rest, and their companions, traduced the Prophets, &amp; were punished after their demerits; neverthelesse, the Infidels
<PB N="281" REF="153"/>
consider not that they shall be chastised, when the trumpet shall sound at the day of Judgment, and that they shall no more return on earth to be converted. They say in scorn, Lord give us to see the Book of the Accompt of our sins, before the day of Judgment. Persevere, and be patient, be not troubled at their discourse, and call to mind our ser∣vant <HI>David,</HI> stout and zealous in my Law; the Moun∣tains and the Birds praised me with him; they assembled in his presence, &amp; obeyed him; we gave force to his reign, and endued him with knowled and eloquence. Hast thou learnt <HI>Davids</HI> quarrel, when they hindred him to enter in∣to the Temple? and how he feared his Enemies? When they entred towards him, they said unto him, Be not a∣fraid, we have a dispute among us, judge our difference with equity, and teach us the right way. This man is my Brother, he hath fourscore and nineteen sheep; I had but one, which he hath ravished from me, because he was stronger than I. <HI>David</HI> said, He hath done thee wrong, art thou troubled for one Ew? The greatest part of men arose against their neighbor, except such as believe in the Law of God, and observe his Commandments, which are few in number. Then <HI>David</HI> knew that we had tryed him, he implored pardon of his sin, he humbled himselfe, worshiped us, and was converted. We gave him pardon of his fault, we drew him near unto us, and lodged him in a place of content. I said unto him, O <HI>David</HI>! we have established thee on Earth, to determine the differences that shall arise among the people, follow not thine own appe∣tite, it will seduce thee from the way of Salvation; such as shall erre from my Law, shall suffer grievous pains at the day of Iudgment. We have not in vain created the Heaven, and the Earth, as the wicked affirm; misery shall bef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l them, they shall be cast headlong, and burnt in the fire of Hell. Shall I alike entreat the believers, and unbe∣lievers? the righteous and the wicked? This Book! We have sent it to thee, &amp; blessed it, to the end the people may meditate the mysteries thereof; &amp; the wise reap advantage for their salvation. We gave <HI>Solomon</HI> to our servant <HI>David,</HI> he was extreamly zealous in our service. Remember that
<PB N="282" REF="154"/>
horses, ready and vigorous, were presented to him about evening; that he forgot to make his prayer at the houre of Vespers; and said, What? Have I preferred the love of the wealth of the Earth, to the remembrance of God, even untill the Sun set? He caused them to be led back againe, and sacrificed some of them (for expiation of his fault.) He caused their legs and neck to be cut off. We tryed <HI>So∣lomon,</HI> we caused a suppositious person to fit on his throne, and afterwards restored him to his dominions. He said, Lord, give me thy mercy, give me so happy a reigne, that the like hath not been seen; thou art liberall towards thy creatures. We made subject to him the winds, which blow∣ed at his command, where it pleased him. We made the de∣vills subject to him; some built his Palaces, others dived into the Seas, to bring him Pearls, and others were bound and chained to attend his commands; he retained and dis∣missed whom he listed, with rendring an accompt. We drew him neer unto us, and lodged him in a place of content. Re∣member our servant <HI>Job,</HI> that he prayed to his Lord, and sayd, That the Divell had heaped misery and affliction up∣on him. It was said unto him, Strike the earth with thy foot; thou shalt see water spring forth to wash thee, and to drink: We restored to him his children, &amp; his riches, through our special grace, to be an example to posterity. It was said un∣to him, when his wife would have made him to murmur, Take rods in thy hand, strike thy wife, and swerve not from what thou hast promised. We found him patient and zealous in obedience to our Commandments. Remember our servant, <HI>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,</HI> affectionate and zea∣lous in our Law; we saved, and chose them, among the righteous. Such as have my fear before their eyes, shall en∣joy the delights of the Garden of <HI>Eden</HI>; where they shall repose upon most glorious beds; they shall there have all sorts of fruits, and delicious drinke; and their wives shall not look on any but on them. Behold, what is pro∣mised to them at the day of judgement, and these pleasures shall never end.

Thus shall the damned quarrel. Say (to the people) I am sent only to preach unto you the V∣nity of God, the Omnipotent Creator of Heaven &amp; earth, and of all that is between them.

The Angels there prostrated themselves, except the Devil; he was proud, and already in the number of the wicked. Thy Lord said unto him, wherefore dost thou not humble thy self before the work of my hands? Thou art in the number of the proud; he replied, I am better then man, thou hast made me of fire, and hast created him of the dust of the Earth. Then thy Lord said unto him, Get thee hence, thou shalt be chastised on all sides, &amp; my curse be upon thee untill the day of Iudgment. He answered, Lord, defer my punishment untill the day of the Resurre∣ction; he said, I will defer it untill the day appointed. He replied, through thy permission I will tempt all the world, except such as shall be zealous in thy Law, and shall obey thy Commandments. He said, I tell thee true, I tell thee true, I will fill Hell with thee, and those that shall follow thee. Say unto the people I require of you to recompence for my instructions, I am not importunate.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIX The Chapter of Troups, containing seventy five Verses written at <HI>Mecca.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the name of God, gracious &amp; merciful. This book was sent by God, the Omnipotent and wise. We sent it to thee, the contents thereof are most true: worship one God alone, and obey his Commandments; faith proceedeth from him alone: Such as worship any other but him, worship I∣dols. They have said, we would not invoke our Idolls, had they not power to draw us neer to God: Certainly God shall judge one day the difference that is between the beleivers, and unbeleivers; he guidet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not him that is a lyar and impious. If he would have a son, he would make choise of one of his creatures, that should be pleasing to him prai∣sed be God, there is but one God, alwayes victorious, he created the heavens and the earth with proportion; he ma∣keth the night to enter into the day; &amp; the day into the night he created the Sun and the Moon, which performe their course in heaven, untill the day appointed, he is omnipo∣tent and merciful: He hath created all of you of one sole man, of whom he created his wife; he hath given you clean beasts, male and female; he formed you in the wombs of your mothers, form upon from: he brought you out of three <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The ob∣scurity of the mothers belly, her womb, and the skin that infol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you in the womb.</NOTE> obscurities, he alone is your God, and your Lord, the kingdom of the world appertaineth to him, there is no God but he. How can the Infidel depart from his service? If ye will not worship him, he hath nothing to do with you, he desireth not that his creatures should be impious; his Will is, that they praise him; this is his pleasure, and none shall bear the burthen of his neighbour, ye al shall be assem∣bled before him, he wil shew ye what you have done, he knoweth what is in the hearts of men: When man is tou∣ched with any affliction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Gelal∣din.</NOTE> he invoketh God, and turneth; and when he is in prosperity, he forgetteth his vows: he hath said that God hath a companion equall to him, and erreth

from the way of his law Say unto him, thou shalt be a while tollerated, in the end thou shalt be cast headlong into the fire of hell; and he that shall pray to God day and night, erect, prostrate, or on the knee, with fear of the torments of hell, shall enjoy the mercy of his divine Majesty. Are such as labour to be compared to them that are idle? They that have judgment will understand this discourse. Say unto them, oh ye people that beleive in your Lord! have his fear before your eyes; Such as shall do good works in this world shall enjoy abundantly the riches of the earth, God will in∣numerably reward them that persevere in obedience to his Commandments; Say unto them, <HI>I</HI> am commanded to wor∣ship one God, to professe his Vnity, &amp; to be obedient to him. Say unto them, I apprehend the day of Iudgment, if I disobey God my Lord. Say unto them, I will worship but one God; worship ye others, whom ye will. Such as shall de∣spise the Law of God, shal lose their souls, &amp; families at the day of Iudgment. These are two great losses, &amp; most certain they be involved in eternal fire. Thus God preacheth to true beleivers. O my creatures! speak unto them, that have my fear before their eyes, that they adore not idols, and that if they turn to their Lord, they shall enjoy the delights of Paradise. Proclaim to them that hear my Word, and obey my Commandments, that they are in the right way, and well advised; canst thou deliver from the fire of hell him that shall be condemned? Certainly such as obey God, shal enjoy the pleasures of Paradise, wherein flow many rivers, &amp; there shal they dwel eternaly. This is the promise of God he swerveth not from that which he promiseth. Seest thou not that God sendeth raine from heaven, and maketh the rivers to run upon the earth, he causeth plants to spring forth, and herbs of divers colours; thou seest them become yellow; and then altogether drie; this is a sign of his omnipotency. Hath not he to whom <HI>GOD</HI> hath given the light of Faith, received a great grace from his divine Maje∣sty? Misery is upon them, that have a heart hardned &amp; for∣get his law, they are manifestly seduced; he hath sent an ex∣cellent book for the instruction of men, his precepts are alike in purity, and without contradiction: They that
<PB N="286" REF="156"/>
fear God, tremble when they hear mention of this book, and finde their rest in the word of his divine Majesty. This book is the guide of the righteous, God by it gui∣deth whom pleaseth him. He whom God shall seduce, shall finde none to guid him, he shall be precipitated into the fire of Hell at the day of Judgement; it shall be said that day to the wicked, tast the torments that ye have me∣rited; their predecessors defamed the Prophets, and were punished when they least thought of it, God rendred them ign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us in this world, and they shall feel in the other, tormen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s much more greivous, and they know it not. We have taught in this book what is necessary for the salvati∣on of the people, peradventure they will learn it; it is in the Arabique tongue, without falshod and contradiction, per∣haps the people will fly from impiety; God teacheth you a parable: Two men are associates in their traffique; the one is wicked, the other an honest man, are they alike? Praise is due to one sole God; the greatest part of the In∣fidels understand it not. Thou shalt die, all men shall die, and ye shall be assembled at the day of Iudgement, when ye shall dispute together; Who is more unjust, then he that blasphemeth against God, and against the known truth? Shall not the wicked be damned? Such as shall believe the Prophet, and fly impiety, shall obtaine from God what they desire; such is the recompence of the righteous, God shall pardon their sins, and reward them for their good works: doth not he protect his servant? They will terrifie thee wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the Idols which they adore; but he whom God shall mislead, shall finde none able to guide him, and none shall be able to seduce him whom he shall guide, is not he the omnipotent and revenging? If thou ask of the Infidels, who created heaven and earth? they will say it is God; Say unto them, have ye therefore considered the Idols which ye adore, can they exempt you from the wrath of God, when it shall be his pleasure to chastise you? Shall they be able to hinder his grace, when it shall be his will to pardon you? Say unto them, my refuge is God, I am re∣signed to his Will, the wise trust in his divine Majesty. Say unto them, oh people! do as you understand him,
<PB N="287" REF="156"/>
<HI>I</HI> will do as I understand him; ye shall know in the end, that whosoever shall be condemned shall be ashamed, and be precipitated into eternall torments, We have sent unto thee the most true book, to instruct the people; He that shal follow the right way, shal meet with nothing but good; and he that shall go astray, shall meet with nothing but e∣vill; thou art not the guardian of the wicked; God causeth men to dye when the hour of their death is arrived; he de∣ferreth the death of many during their sleep, &amp; remitteth that of others to the time appointed, this is a sign of his omnipotency, to such as consider it, Will ye worship any but God? Say unto them; how shall your Idols be able to in∣tercede for you, since they want power? know you not this? Say unto them, we ought to invoke one God alone, King of the heaven and earth; you all shall one day assemble be∣fore him to be judged. The Infidels tremble with fear, whē they hear mention of one sole God, &amp; rejoyce when they hear speak of their Idols; Say unto them, God is Creator of the heavens and the earth, he knoweth the past, present, and future; (Lord!) thou shalt one day judge the differences of thy creatures: Should the Infidels possess al the riches of the earth, and yet as much more, they would not be able to escape the fire of Hel at the day of Iudgment; they shall be punished more greivously then they imagine, their sins shall be set before them, and they shall feel the rigors of the torments which they despise: man calleth upon us, when he is in affliction, and we give him our grace, he saith, he meriteth it: on the contrary, this is to prove him, but most of them are ignorant of it; their predecessors spake as they; the good that they have done, hath profitted them nothing; and the misery that they have merited, is faln upon them, they shall not escape the punishment of their crimes. Know they not that God giveth and taketh a∣way wealth from whom pleaseth him? This is a signs of his omnipotency for the righteous. Say unto them, oh people! they who have off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nded God, ought not to de∣spair of his grace, he is gracious and mercifull; be ye Con∣verted, and recommend your selves to his will before ye be condemned, otherwise ye shall remain without protection;
<PB N="288" REF="157"/>
follow the instruction that God hath sent to you, before ye be chastised, the punishment of your crimes shall surprise you, ye know not the time; the wicked shall be afflicted, for that they have not obeyed Gods Commandments, they shall know their damnation, and the sin that they have committed, in scorning the trve-believers: They shall say, had God guided me into the right-way, I had had his fear before my eyes. When they shall see hell, they shal say, could I return into the world, I would be in the number of the righteous; on the contrary, my Commandments were taught you, but ye became proud, and dispised them. Thou shalt s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that day how the visages of Infidels shall be blackned: Is there not a place in hell prepared for the proud? God loveth, and putteth into a place of felicity them that fear him, they shall not be touched, either with displeasure or affliction; God hath created all things and disposeth all at his pleasure; he hath in his power the keyes of heaven and earth, such as disobey him are dam∣ned. Say unto them, oh ignorant [men] will ye enjoyn me to worship another god, besides God? It hath been preached to you, and your predecessors, that all your good works shall be unprofitable, if ye adore many gods, and that you shall be in the number of the damned: there is but one God, worship him, and be mindfull of his graces. The Infidels have not praised God as he ought to be prai∣sed, they have no knowledge of his power, he shall make earth to tremble, and gather together the heavens by the strength of his right hand at the day of Iudgment; praised be God, he hath no companion. When the Trumpet shall sound the first time, he shal cause to dis, whom he will have to die in the heavens and earth; the second time all the world shall rise again, and attend his commandments; the earth shall be full of the light of the Lord thereof, he shall bring his book, where in shal be written what the Prophets &amp; Martyrs have taught, he shal judg the world with equity, &amp; shall not do injustice to any; every one shal be rewarded &amp; chastised for his works, he knoweth all that they have don he shal send the Infidels into the fire of hel, in troops; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen they shal be arrived at the gate, it shal open before

their eyes; it shall be said unto them, behold Hell, which ye have merited; were there not Prophets and Apostles, to teach you the Commandments of God, and to preach unto you on Earth the coming of this rigorous day? They shall say, yes, but the word of God shall be accomplished against the wicked. It shall be said unto them, goe, enter into Hell, ye shall abide there eternally, it is the habitation of the proud. Such as shall have the fear of God before their eyes, shall be conducted in troups to the gate of Paradise, the gate shall open before their eyes; it shall be said unto them, behold what ye have gained, the peace of God is with you, ye have not been ignorant, enter into Paradise, ye shall dwel therein eternally. They shall say, praised be God, for that we believed in his Law; and because we are heirs of his grace, we will goe into Paradise, into what place shall seeme good to us, God giveth his blessing to the righteous. Thou shalt see the Angels about the throne of thy Lord, who shall praise and exalt his glory; they shall say, God hath judged his creatures with equity, praise is due to the Lord of the Vniverse.</P>

<P>IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull. God is pru∣dent and wise. This Book is sent by the omnipotent, who knoweth all things, who pardoneth sinnes, and accep∣teth the conversion of his Creatures, he is severe in his cha∣stisements, and indulgent to his people, there is no God but he, and all the world shall one day be assembled before his divine Majesty [to be judged.] No man disputeth a∣gainst the precepts of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> but the wicked; be not thou discontented if they live on earth with some felicity; the people of <HI>Noahs</HI> time contemned his instructions,
<PB N="290" REF="158"/>
their posterity did like them, and every Nation hath conspired the death of them whom God sent to instruct them; thy disputed to obscure the truth through their lies, but they were punished; and after what manner? So is the word of God accomplished against the wicked, they all shall be damned. The Angells that are about the Throne of God, and those that bear him, praise and exalt his divine Majesty, they beleive in his unity, and beg pardon of him for the True-believers; Lord, Lord, thy mercy extendeth through the whole world nothing is hid from thee, either in Heaven or Earth, par∣don their sins that convert, and embrace thy holy Law, deliver them from the fire of Hell, open to them the gate of the gardens of <HI>Eden,</HI> which thou hast prepared for them their Fathers, wives, and children, and them of their line∣age that shal do good works thou art omnipotent and wise Depart from sin, he that shall depart [from it] shall resent the effects of Gods mercy at the day of Iudgment, and shall enjoy eternall felicity; the Infidels shall be hated of God, his hatred is far more dangerous then yours; wil ye be In∣dels after being called to the observation of the Law of Salvation? They said, Lord, wilt thou cause us to dye twice and shall we twice rise againe? But they shall say at the the day of Judgment, Lord, we confesse we have offended thee, we acknowledge our sinne, in having renounced the belief of thine unity; Shall we never go out of Hell, to observe thy Law, and follow the way of salvation? No, ye shal suffer in the fire of Hell, because that ye have be¦lievd them that adored Idols, and because ye have said, that God hath companions equall to him. All things obey one sole God omnipotent, he it is that made you to see his Miracles, and sendeth you the riches of Heaven and Earth; none consider it but such as are converted. Pray to God, and observe his LAW, although it be against the will of the wicked; he elevateth his Creatures to what degree he listeth, he hath created his Throne, and sent his inspirations to whom he seeth good, to preach the day of Judgement; that day shall the people come out of their Monuments, &amp; none shal be able
<PB N="291" REF="158"/>
to hide himselfe from his divine Majesty. Who shall com∣mand that day? It shall be God alone, victorious; that day shall he recompense every one after his works, without injustice, he is exact to make accompt. If thou preach to the wicked the day of Judgement, their heart will lift them up, and they shall be full of affliction, their prayers shall not be heard, and none shall intereede for them: God knoweth them that have eyes of treachery, and seeth all that is in the hearts of men, he judgeth of every thing with truth; the I∣dols which they worship are without power, God alone un∣derstandeth all things, and is omnipotent. Consider they not what was the end of their predecessors? who were more powerfull, and more wealthy then they? God surprized them in their sinnes, there was none of power to save them, for that they despised the Prophets of his divine Majesty, they contemned his Law, and were impious, but he severe∣ly chastised them, he is omnipotent, and most severe.</P>
<P>Wee sent <HI>Moses</HI> with miracles, with reasons cleare and intelligible to <HI>Pharoah,</HI> to <HI>Haman,</HI> and <HI>Caron</HI>; they said that <HI>Moses</HI> was A Sorcerer, and a Lyar; and when hee preached to them the truth on our be∣halfe, they said, kill him, with all those that believe him, and make their wives infamous; but their conspiracy was but impiety: <HI>Pharoah</HI> said, hinder me not to kill <HI>Moses,</HI> let him invoke his God to save him, <HI>I</HI> fear that he may alter your Law, and introduce some disorder in the Land; <HI>Moses</HI> said, God, mine and your Lord, shall defend me from the malice of the proud, that believe not the day of judgement: Then a man of the domestiques of <HI>Pharoah,</HI> that secretly professe the true Law, said, will ye slay a man that decla∣reth that <HI>God</HI> is his Lord? and that hath made you to see miracles? if he be a lyar, his lye shal be against him, but if he speak the truth, something of what he hath preached shall befal you, <HI>God</HI> guideth nether the wicked nor lyars.

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem at the day of Iudgment, oh people of <HI>Pharoah</HI>! goe, enter into the fire of Hell. The Infidels shal quarrell in Hell, the poor shall say unto the rich; We followed you, are you able this day to deliver us from eternal flames? they shall answer, we all are damned with you, <HI>God</HI> is a most just Iudge. The damned shall say to the Ministers of Hell, Pray to your Lord, that he may asswage these torments for one day; they shall answer, had ye not on earth the Prophets and Apostles of <HI>God</HI> to instruct you? They shall say yes; pray therefore to God your selves; the wicked love nothing but impiety; I will protect on earth my Prophets, and them that observe my Law, and particularly at the day of judg∣ment; that day the wicked shall have no excuse that shal ad∣vantage them, my curse shall fall upon them, and they all shall be damned. We taught <HI>Moses</HI> the way of Salvation, and made the Children of Israel heirs of his in∣structions, to instruct them that shal understand them. Per∣severe and be patient, the promise of God is infallible; im∣plore pardon of thy sinnes, and exalt the praise of thy Lord evening and morning. They that dispute against the Com∣mandments of God are without reason, and have nought in their souls but pride and ignorace: Implore succor of God, he understandeth and seeth all things, the Creation of the Heavens, and of the Earth, is greater then the Creation of men, but the greatest part of men know it not; the blind is not like to him that seeth clearly; he that doth good; is not like to him that doth evill, neither is obscuri∣ty such as the light, but few men consider it. Doubtlesse the day of Iudgment shall come, neverthelesse the greatest part of men will not believe it: Your Lord hath said, call upon me, I will heare you; Such as shall resist my Law, shall go into Hell, and be eternally seduced. God hath created the night for repose, and the day for travell, he is bountiful towards his Creatures, bvt the greatest part of the peopple are ingratefull, <HI>GOD</HI> is your LORD, Creator of all things, there is no GOD but he.

Such as reject our Commandments, and what we enjoyed our Prophets to preach to men, shall find their errors, when they shall see chaines on their necks, and fetters on their feet; they shall be dragged and burned in Hell; then shall it be said unto them, where are those Idols that yee adored upon Earth? they shall answer, they are departed from us, certainly they are without power; thus God seduceth Infidels, to their confusion. It shall be said unto them, these paines befall you, for that ye were proud and insolent without reason; enter within the gates of Hell, which is the habitation of the proud, ye shall dwell there eternally. Be patient and persevere, the word of God is infallible; I will make thee to see a part of what I have promised to men, I will cause thee to dye, and thou shalt behold them all assembled to be judged.

The people of <HI>Aad</HI> waxed proud on the Earth without reason, and said, Who is more powerfull then we? will they not consider, that he that created them, is more powerful and wealthy then they? Neverthelesse they despised our Commad∣ments. We sent against them a cold and impetuous wind, in an unhappy time, that made them to suffer on Earth shame and ignominy, because of their crimes: He shall cause them to feel the pains of Hell, that are much greater then those of the Earth, and they shall be eternally depri∣ved of protection. We instructed the men of <HI>Temod</HI> in the right way; they preferred blindnesse to light, and impiety to Salvation; they were surprized by thunder, and suffered great afflictions, because of their sins. We saved none of them, but the believers, who had our fears before their eyes.

If the Infi∣dels res<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st the Faith, the Angels that are in Paradise defist not, notwithstanding, to exalt the glory of his divine Majesty, day and night, without intermission.

Had we sent the <HI>Alcoran</HI> in the Persian tongue, to a Prophet; an <HI>Arabian</HI> by Nation; the wicked would have said, That the divine mysteries are not well explained. Say unto them, It is the guide of Believers, and a remedy to their ignorance.

Whosoever shall doe good, shall find good; and the evill that a man committeth shall be against him. Thy Lord doth no injustice to his Creatures: None but he knoweth the day of Iudgement; no fruit nor flower spring∣eth out of the Earth, and woman neither conceiveth nor bringeth forth, but by his permission. Be thou mind∣ful of the day that the lord shal cal Idolaters, &amp; demand of them where be their Idols?

Will they say that thou hast blasphemed against <HI>God</HI>?

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the name of God, gracious and mercifull: God is prudent and wise. I swear by the book that teacheth to do well, that we have sent it in the <HI>Arabique</HI> tongue, perad∣venture ye shall understand the <HI>Alcoran</HI>; it is written in in our originall Booke, majestique and mysterious. Shall I conceal from you the book of Salvation, if ye be wicked? How many Prophets and Apostles have we sent in past Ages, whom unbeleivers have despised? We destroyed the most powerful among them, and all have incurred the pain of their predecessors. If thou ask of them who crea∣ted Heaven and Earth, they will say, that it is the omnipo∣ten, who knoweth all things. Who hath extendeth the earth under you? Who established the wayes to guide you? It is God, he causeth the rain to descend from Heaven in your necessity; he maketh the dead, drie, and barren fields to revive; in like manner shall the dead come out of their Sepulchers. He it is that created whatsoever is in the world, of divers kinds and Species, and created the SHIPS, and BEAST, to carry you. Remember
<PB N="304" REF="165"/>
the grace of your Lord, say, praised be he that created <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or us these things; we had not the power to create them. They all shall return before the Lord to be judged. The Infidels have divided God into many parts. Certainly he that saith that there are many Gods, is impious; hath he appointed you to say, that the Angels which he hath created are his daughters, seeing that he giveth you sonnes? When it is declared to some Infidels that a Daughter is born to him, he is not satisfied, (he desireth to have a son) will they say that God adorneth himselfe, and taketh ornaments to beautifie him like their Idols? It is a manifest error they say, that the Angels that worship God, are the daughters of his divine Majesty; I will write what they say, and will r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quire of them a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> accompt of their discourse at the day of Iudgement. They have said, had it pleased God, we had not adored the Angels; They know not what they say, and ignorantly blaspheme; do they observe any Scripture that hath been taught them heretofore? On the contrary, they say that their fathers lived in like manner, and that they follow their steps; they have said as much to all the Prophets that were sent unto them. When thou spakest to them to observe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat is contained in the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and to abandon the Idols which their fathers worshipped, they answered, that they believed neither in thee, nor in thy mis∣sion; but we avenged our selves upon them; Consider what is the end of blaspheme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; Remember thou, that <HI>Abraham</HI> said to his father, and his people, I am innocent of the sin that you commit, in adoring Idols, I wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ship him alone that created me, he shall guide me into the way of Salvati∣on, and hath left his words to posterity; perhaps the Infi∣dels shall be converted.

I will cause to fall headlong with the Devils, such as shall reject the Law of the mercifull; the Devils shall be their companions, they shall seduce them from the way of Sal∣vation, and they shall not know it.

Wilt thou guide them that wilfully erre? If they dye before being punished on Earth, I will be avenged on them in the other world. Shall I shew thee during thy life, the punishment that we have prepared for them? We can do it, but do thou only what hath been commanded thee, thou art in the way of salva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, instruct men therein; an accompt of thy mission shal be required of thee. I wil require an accompt of their mission that we sent heretofore to instruct the people, we wil demand of them, if we ap∣pointed them to worship any other <HI>God</HI> but us. Wee sent <HI>Moses</HI> to <HI>Pharoah,</HI> and his Ministers, he caused them to see our Miracles, &amp; preached to them our Commandment; he told them that he was the Messenger of the God of the V∣niverse, neverthelesse they scoffed. <HI>I</HI> shewed them no grea∣ter Miracle then that of <HI>Moses</HI> his sister, and we chastised them, because of their n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>redulity.

The people would not hearken to the Sonne of <HI>Mary,</HI> when he spake by parable; they said, our Gods are more profitable to us then his lyes, and questions.

He shall an∣swer them, ye shall abide there Eternally; We have taught men the truth, but the greatest part of them would not be∣lieve it. The wicked have conspired against thee, and we conspired against them; think they that I know not their secrets, and whatsoever they utter? The Angels our Mes∣sengers keep accompt. Say unto them, if <HI>God</HI> have a Son, who shall we first adore? Praised be God, King of the Heavens and of the Earth; the matter is not as the Infi∣dels deliver it: Leave them implunged in their impiety, let them Laugh and rejoyce, untill the day of their pu∣nishment arrive: One <HI>God</HI> alone ought to be worshiped in Heaven and Earth, he is most wise and omniscient.

<P>IN the name of God, gracious and merciful. God is most prudent and wise. This Book is sent by the Omnipotent and wise. The Heavens and the Earth are most certain signes of his Vnity, to such as believe in his Law; your Creation, and the Creation of all Creatures, are marks of his greatnesse to them that have his fear before their Eyes; the difference of the night, and the day; the rain that he sendeth from Heaven, to cause fruits to spring out of the Earth, and to revive it after its death; and the diversity of wind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, are signes of his Omnipotency to them that have knowledg to comprehend it. <HI>I</HI> relate to thee the wonders of God with truth; in what will Infidels believe, if they believe not in the word of his divine Majesty? Misery is upon them that hear the Commandments of God, and become proud, as if they had not heard them. Preach unto such men, that they shall suffer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he rigors of infinite pains. They deride the Faith when they are spoken to: Certainly, they be punished in the fire of Hell, their riches shall not be able to save them, neither the Idols which they adore; they shall be eternally damned. This Book guideth men into the way of salvation; they that shall not believe in the Law of God, shall feel the effects of his fury. He created the Seas that bear the Ships for the advantage of your com∣merce, peradventure ye will acknowledg this grace: He hath created for you, all that is in Heaven and on Earth; it is a sign of his goodness to such as consider it. Speak unto them that believe in the Law of Salvation, that they pardon those that have not the fear of God before their Eyes. God shall chastise them after their demirits. Whosoever shall do good, shall finde good; and ye shall be assembled be∣fore his divine Majesty, to be judged. Certaiuly we instructed the children <HI>Israel</HI> in the Scripture, and our Commandments; we taught them know∣ledg,
<PB N="311" REF="168"/>
and gave them the grace of Prophesie; we en∣riched them with all sorts of riches, &amp; preferred them to al the world. We taught them our Law, none disputed a∣gainst our Commandmenes, but such as had knowledg, &amp; that through the envy thar arose among them; but thy Lord shall judg their differences at the day of Iudgment. We have sent thee our Law, observe it, and follow not the ap∣petites of the ignorant, they shall not be able to deliver thee from eternall pains. The Infidels obey each other, and the true-belivers obey God. This book is the light of the world, it guideth into the way of Salvation and the mercy of God, them that believe in his divine Majesty. Do the wicked imagine they shall be intreated like the godly in their life and death, and that they shall not be judged? God hath created heaven and earth for a mark of his power, he shall judg every one according to their works, and shall do injustice to none: Consider how they worship what co∣meth into their fancy, God hath seduced them from his certain knowledge, he hath rendred them deaf, hath hard∣ned their heart, &amp; blinded them; who shal guide, if God seduce them? Do they not consider it? They say our re∣surrection shal be like the life of this world; some dy, others are born; length of years cause us to die, they know not what they say, and speak but by opinion. When they are preached unto, they have no other' discourse to utter, but make our fathers to revive, if what we say be true. Say un∣to them, God causeth you to live &amp; dy, &amp; shal assem∣ble you at the day of Iudgment; there is no doubt in this, but the greatest part of the people know it not. God is the King of the heavens &amp; earth, &amp; of the day of judgment; that day shall he assemble the Infidels; thou shalt see all Sects, and all Religions assembled before him upon their knees, every sect shall see their sins written in a particular book &amp; shal be al chastised after their demerits, It shall be said unto them, behold the book that speaketh against you, we have exactly written what you have don; God shal give his mercy to the righteous, that is, supream felicity.

That day shall the Infidels be enemies to

each other, and the Idols shall not acknowledge them that have worshipped them. When they heard the <HI>Alcoran</HI> read, they affirmed it to contain the truth; and when they were commanded to observe it, they said, that it is but magick. Will they say that thou hast invented it? Say unto them, if I have invented it, ye cannot deliver me from the pu∣nishment of God, he knoweth all that is in this book, it is sufficient that he is witnesse between you and me, he is gra∣cious and mercifull: Say unto them, <HI>I</HI> am not the first Prophet, nor the first Apostle that God hath sent, I know not what God shall determine of you and me, I do but what he hath inspired into me, and am sent to preach the torments of hel; have ye considered in what condition ye shall be, if the <HI>Alcoran</HI> be sent from God? Ye have renoun∣ced it, but one of the children of <HI>Israel</HI> is witnesse that it is sent from God, and hath believed in his divine Majesty, neverthelesse ye are become proud; God guideth not the proud. The Infidels say to the believers, if the <HI>Alcoran</HI> were any good thing, you should not exceed us in obser∣ving it, it guideth not into the way of salvation, it is but an old Fable; The book of <HI>Moses</HI> that came before it, teacheth the right way, and the Will of God: Say unto them, the <HI>Alcoran</HI> confirmeth the Scriptures sent hereto∣fore to them that precedeed us, it is in the Arabique tongue; he preacheth the pains of hell to unbelievers, and declareth the joyes of Paradise to the righteous. Such as shall believe that God is their Lord, and shall obey him, ought to fear nothing, they shall suffer none affliction at the day of Judgment, they shall enjoy Pardadise for the reward of their good works. We have recommended to man, to honor father and mother, and to do good to them; his mother beareth him with pain, she bringeth forth with dolour, she giveth him suck, and weaneth him at the end of thirty moneths; she hath care [of him] until he be in a con∣dition to govern himself, &amp; hath attained to age of discre∣tion.

God pardoneth the sinne that thou didst commit, when thou wert too prompt, and when thou wert too tardy, [to fight for his Law;] he shall accomplish his grace upon thee, he shall guide thee into the right way, and shall powerfully protect thee; he hath delivered the hearts of the believers from fear, to augment their faith; he disposeth the forces of the Heavens and Earth, he knoweth all, and is most prudent.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the name of God, gracious and merciful. O ye that belevie! prefer not what ye have done, to what God and his Prophet hath performed, and fear God, he heareth what soever ye say, and seeth all that ye do. O ye that beleieve! when ye shall speak to the Prophet, speak not louder then he; cry not, as when ye talk among your selves, least ye render your good works vain and unprofitable, and know it not; God hath tryed the vertue of them that speak low in the presence of the Prophet, he shall pardon their sinns, and give them an exceeding great reward. They that call thee behind the Inclosures, know not what they do; had they attended untill thou hadst been towards them, they had done very well, God is gracious and merciful. O ye that believe! if any Infidel desireth to preach to you, distinguish the truth from a lye; if ye give credit to the ignorant, ye shall repent you. Know that the Apostle of God is a∣mong you; ye shall offend God, if ye obey unbelievers in many things, God willeth that ye embrace his Law, it shal rejoyce your hearts; and make ye to abhorre disobe∣dience and impiety: such as abhorre it, are stedfast in their faith, through his speciall grace, he knoweth them, and is most wise. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> two Nations, or two Provinces, of such as believe in God are at odds, reconcile them; if the one doe injury to the other, fight against him that is unjust untill he repai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e what God hath ordained; if he make reparati∣on, reconcile them with equity; be just, God loveth them that do justice to his people: all those that believe in his LAW, are BRETHREN; make peace a∣mong your brethren, and fear God, he shall give you his mercy O ye that believe! scorn not your neighbour per∣adventure that he shall one day be of better value then

you. O ye women! scorn not others, perhaps they shall one day be more worth then you. Vtter no reproaches, and give no name to your neighbour that may displease him; call him by his name, otherwise ye will disobey <HI>God</HI>: such as repent not, are exceedingly too blame. O ye that believe in <HI>God</HI>! take heed of evill thoughts, these are of∣tentimes in the number of sins; do no displeasure to your neighbour, and speak to each other nothing that may dis∣please: who among you would eat the flesh of his dead brother? ye shall abhor it; fear therefore God, who is gra∣cious and merciful to such as have his fear before their eyes. O people! we created you male and female; we have caused to issue out of your loyns people and Nations; ye koow each other, but your greatest honour is, to fear God, he knoweth you, and understandeth, all your secrets. Some among the <HI>Arabians</HI> have said, we believe; say unto them, say not we believe, but say, we are obedient, other∣wise faith shall not enter into your hearts; if ye obey God and his Prophet, ye shall be recompenced for your good works, God is gracious and merciful to them that obey his Commandments. Such as are beloved of God, believe in his Vnity, and in his Prophet, they doub not of his Law, and imploy their persons and wealth for the propagation of the faith. Say unto them, know ye not that your Law proceedeth from <HI>God</HI>? he knoweth whatsoever is in the heavens and earth, he knoweth all. They think to do thee a pleasure in saving them, say unto them, believe not that ye pleasure me, for it is God that guideth you into the way of salvation; ye ought so to believe it; God knoweth all that is in the heavens and earth, and beholdeth whatso∣ever ye do.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the name of God, gracious &amp; merciful. I swear by the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> worthy of praise, that the Inhabitants of Mecca wonder that a man of their Nation teacheth them the tor∣ments of hell; they say, that he speaketh strange things. What, say they, shall we die? shall we be earth, and return into the world? Behold a very strong return! We know assuredly what the earth will do with us, we have a book, wherein all is written; they impugne the known truth, &amp; are in a great confusion: See they not heaven above them, how we have built it? how we have adorned it? and how there is no defect? We have extended the earth, raised the mountains, and caused all sorts of fruits to spring forth, for a sign of our omnipotency. We have sent the blessed raine from heaven, made gardens to produce grain, pleasing to the Reapers, and Date trees, exceeding each other in height, to enrich our creatures. We have given life to the dead, dry, &amp; barren earth; so shall the dead come out of their sepulchers. The peopl of <HI>Noahs</HI> time, those that inhabited ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r the wel, <HI>Temod, Pharoah,</HI> and the fellow Citizens of <HI>Lot</HI>; they that d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elt in the Forrest, and people of <HI>King Teba,</HI> did hereto∣fore traduce our Prophets,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Teba</HI> was a King of <HI>Lieme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE> and felt the punishment denoun∣ced against Infidells.

We created man without difficulty, we know the mo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions of his soul, &amp; penetrate into his heart as the bloud in to the veins of his body. O man! think upon the day that thou shalt see thy good and evill Angell near thee, at the right hand, and on thy left, they have observed and written all that thou hast done; represent to thy self death before thine eies, it is inevitable: Think on the Angel that shall sound the Trumpet at the day of the Resurrection; that day shall the wicked behold what was promised them, and all men shall come before God to be judged. Their guardian Angels shall conduct them, and be the witnesses of their deportments: It shall be said to the Infidells, behold the day of which ye would have no thoughts; we have now o∣pened your eyes, you shal see this day more hard then iron; their guardian Angells shall say unto them, behold here b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣fore your eyes all that ye have done; cast into Hell those obstinate Infidels, that have hindrd their neighbour to do good, that have offended in doubting of Gods Law, and have affirmed there was another god with God; cast them into the most grievous torments. Then shall the Devill say to them, Lord, I did not seduce them, they seduced them∣selves; God shall say, dispute not before me, what was here∣tofore promised you is infallible, my Word admitteth no al∣teration, and I will do injustice to none. God shall ask at the day of judgment, if hell be full? it shall answer, is there any more? Paradise is prepared for thē righteous, who shal have the fear of God before their eyes, it is promised to thē that shall be converted, that shall obey the Commendments of his divine Majesty, and persevere in their obendience. It shall be said to them, enter ye into Paradise, exempt from all evill; behold the eternall day, ye shall have all that ye shall desire and more. How rich and powerful Cities have we in times past destroyed? their inhabitants sought in their Countryes places of retreat, and escaped not the pu∣nishment of their crimes; this ought to serve for example to them that comprehend it, to them that hear it, and to such that saw it. Certainly we created in six dayes, without difficulty, the heaven &amp; earth, &amp; all that is between them. Persevere, be not impatient for the words of unbelievers,

The people heretofore belyed <HI>Noah,</HI> and said, that he was possessed of the Devill; <HI>Noah</HI> exhorted them, and invoked his Lord; in the end, he said, that his strength was gon, and that he was overcome through the malice of men, then was he powerfully succored; we opened the gate of the Heavens, and caused an extraordinary raine to fall, wee caused FOVNTAINES to issue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orth from under the Earth, the water of Heaven and Earth were gathered together, and overwhelmed the Infidels, because of their sins; We saved <HI>Noah</HI> in the Arke, well pinned, and chaulked it floated upon the water trough our p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mission, to serve for a token of our omnipotency; will any of the vn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elievers of this time consider this? will they consider the punishment of their crimes, and the

No, he is an Imposter; but in the end, they knew them that were wick∣ed, and lyars. We sent the Camell to prove the Infidels; their Prophet observed what they did, and was patient, the water was divided for them and for the Camel, and each at his day found to drinke, neverthelesse they called their Companions, and slew the Camell of <HI>Salhe,</HI> but in what manner were they chastised? I darted thunder against them; which made them drie as chaffe; We have made the <HI>Alco∣ran</HI> easie to be understood, will there be any to study it? <HI>Lots</HI> Citizens traduced him, and despised his instructions; We sent against them an hot winde, with burning stones, that destroyed them, and we in the morning saved <HI>Lot,</HI> with his family, throught our speciall grace; thus do I recompense them that ackowledge my benefits. <HI>Lot</HI> had preached to them the pains of hel, we surprized them, when they disputed against his exhortations, they saw his guests to enter into the city, in the figure of men; we blinded their sight, and said, Tast oh ye wicked! the punishment of your crimes; In the morning they wery chastised with a perpetu∣all chastisement, because they despised the words of Lot▪ We have made the <HI>Alcoran</HI> intelligible, will there be any that will study it?

God hath not to doe with them that obey Infidels, neither hath he need of any person, and praise is due to him in all places; peradventure he will establish for the future great amity between you and them that ye hate, he is omnipotent, gracious, and mercifull; he doth prohi∣bite you the conversation of them that fight not against you for his faith, and that expel you not from your hou∣ses, he doth not forbid you to do them justice, he loveth the just; He forbiddeth you to converse with them that fight against your faith; that drive you from your houses, and aide to expell you; he prohibiteth you to obey them, and to contract amity with them; such as obey them, shall be exceedingly too blame. O ye that beleeve in God! when the wives of your enemies shall throw themselves into your party, trie their conscience; if ye know them to be faithfull, and to believe in the Law of God, restore them not to the incredulous Infidels, it is not lawfull for them to know them, neither for the women to teach them; give them subsistance, ye shall not sin in espousing them: mar∣ry them not after the laws of unbelievers; demand of them what dowry they require, they shall demand of you what ye are willing to bestow on them; continue in accord, God so commandeth, he shall be your Judge at the day of Judgement, he knoweth all your actions, and is most wise.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the Name of God, gracious and mercifull. I swear by the Pen, and by all that is written, that thou art not possessed of the Devill; through the grace of thy Lord; thou shalt have an infinite reward; God hath created thee, with a creation high, and most illustrious. Thou shalt hereafter know, and the Infidels likewise shall know one day, them among you that are ignorant. Certainly thy Lord knoweth them that are seduced, and them that follow the right way. Obey not the wicked, they desire thee to be more indulgent towards them, and themselves more milde towards thee; Obey not those infamous ly∣ars, those bablers, sinners, seducers, and wicked persons, full of treasures and children; When the Mysteries of faith are related to them, they say, that they are but fa∣bles of antiquitie; we will put upon their noses a mark of shame, and ignominy; we have tryed them, as Gar∣deners, when they have resolved in the evening to cut off the morning following some fruits of their garden, for their refection, and have not said, if it please God; By night, which they slept, God sent fier into their gardens, that consumed them; in the morning they called [each other] and said, come to put order to your garden, if ye desire to gather the fruits; they believed the poore would enter they ran [to drive them away] and found their fruits black, and their gardens blasted: Then they said,
<PB N="359" REF="192"/>
we are seduced, we are sinners; one of them said that it was requisite to praise God; Then they said, praised be God, we are great sinners; they approached each other, and complained among themselves: They said, misery is upon us; we were in a great error, peradventure God will give us hereafter more then the value of what we have lost, we must beg his grace; thus God chastiseth on earth, whom he pleaseth▪ but the torments of the other world are much more grievous: They that have his fear before their eyes, shall dwell in gardens full of delights. Shall I intreat the good like the wicked? How can ye judge it? have ye a book, wherein you reade what pleas∣eth you? have we promised to you any content at the day of Judgement? Shall you have that day what ye have pro∣mised to your selves? Ask of them, who will be surety for their belief? will their Idols, and companions be their surety! Let them cause them to come, if they be true: Be thou mindfull of the day when sins shall be detected, and the wicked shall be commanded to worship God, but they shall not be able to behold him, their eyes shall be troub∣led with fear, and their sight covered with shame. They are enjoyned in the world to worship his divine Majesty, but they refuse to perform it; I will punish them by little and little, when they shall least think of it; I will defer the punishment of their crimes, because my wrath is strong; Dost thou demand of men any recompence for thy preaching? are they charged with any expence? Have they in their power the book, wherein is the future, to write therein what they affirm? Attend the Judgement of thy Lord, and be not like him that was swallowed of the Whale. He invoked his Lord in his affliction; if his Lord had not sent him his grace, he should never have come upon earth; when he repented of his sin, his Lord pardo∣ned, and placed him in the number of the righteous. The unbelievers labour to shake thee through their looks, and that through envie; they affirm, that thou art possessed of the Devill, when they hear thee read the <HI>Alcoran</HI>; It was not sent but to instruct the world.</P>

We preserved you in <HI>Noahs</HI> Ark, when the waters swelled, to serve for exam∣ple of our omnipotency to them that saw it, and to such as shall hear it mentioned. Be thou mindfull of the day when the Angell shall sound the Trumpet, when the earth shall lift it selfe up, and the mountains tremble; then what must come to passe, shall come to passe; heaven with weakness shall open, and the Angel that shall bear the throne of God, shall be upon the border of the heaven. Then shall eight Angels present the books, wherein shall be written the sinnes of men, and nothing shall be concealed. Such as shall take in the right hand the book of the accompt of their actions, shall say, wee finde what we believed to be true, we know with certain knowledge the comming of this day, and the felicity of life is in Paradise: It shall be said to them, eat and drink of the good things of Paradise at your pleasure. They that shall take the book of accompt of their acti∣ons in their left hand, shall say, would to God that this

book had been lost, I know not what is this accompt; would to God that I had been eternally buried in the earth: the riches, authority, and treasures of the world are to me unprofitable: It shall be said to the devils, take them, binde them, and throw them headlong into hell, put chains seventy cubits long upon their arms, and cast them into fire; they would not believe in the Unity of God the Omnipotent; they have eaten the bread of the poor, they are this day without protection, and want bread, and shall find nothing but the pains of hell pre∣pared for the wicked.

It is not the word of one that is wicked, but few men remember it; it is sent from God, Lord of the Universe. The Infidels say, oh Pro∣phet! if thou speak, we will not hear thee, thy speech shall not enter into our hearts: Say unto them, there is none among you able to deliver you from the punishment of your crimes; the <HI>Alcoran</HI> instructeth in the way of salvation them that believe in his divine Majesty; I know that there are lyars among you, whom God shall put into the number of Infidels: the <HI>Alcoran</HI> is truth it self.

they are far from that day, but thou shalt see it spee∣dily, that day shall the heaven resemble dissolved met∣tall; the mountains shall be like to carded wooll, which bendeth downwards; none shall ask his neighbour who he is, and they shall look one upon another; the unbelie∣vers shall desire to redeem themselves from these pains, through the loss of their children, their wives, their bre∣thren, their companions, their neighbours, and the loss of all that is on earth. The flame of fire shall rise upon them, and shall burn the skin of their head; they shall call upon those that are behinde them, that have, like them∣selves, abandoned the Law of God; and the covetous, that shall have heaped up treasures. Man was created timerous, he is afraid when evill befalleth him, and is ar∣rogant when good hapneth to him; except the believers, who are stable in their faith, that persevere in their pray∣ers, that give alms to the poor that beg, and those that are bashfull, that believe in the day of Judgement, feare the punishment of God, and know none other women but their own, and their slaves, they shall be exempt from af∣fliction at the day of Judgement; those that shall act the contrary, shall be in the number of the unjust. They who effect what they have promised, and preserve faithfully what to them hath been entrusted, who speak the truth in testimony, and who make their prayers at the time ap∣pointed, shall be honoured in Paradise. Wherefore is it that the Infidels, who are about thee, cast their eyes to the right hand, and to the left, with pride? do they require to enter into Paradise, and be saved?

<HEAD>CHAP. LXXI. The Chapter of <HI>Noah,</HI> containing twenty eight Verses, written at <HI>Mecca.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the Name of God, gracious and mercifull. Before men were chastised, we sent <HI>Noah</HI> to preach to them the pains of hell; he said unto them, O ye people! I preach to you the pains of hell, worship one only God, and fear him, obey me, he shall pardon your sins, hee deferreth your punishment untill the day appointed, and shall not retard it; when his hour shall be come, did ye know it, ye would be converted. Afterward he said, Lord, I have exhorted this people night and day, but mine exhortati∣ons have been very much in vain, they have strengthned themselves in their impiety, and when I preached to them, they put their fingers into their ears, and covered their heads with their garments, that they might not hear; they continue in their impiety, and become proud: I have preached to them publikely, I lifted up my voyce, I have expounded to them the mysteries of thy Law; I said unto them, implore pardon of God, he is most merciful; he shall send you abundance of rain to water the earth▪ he shall give you store of wealth, and many children; he shall give you gardens embellished with fountains, and rivers; who h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndreth you to honour God?

Lord, said, <HI>Noah,</HI> this people hath diso∣beyed me, they have followed that which can give them neither prosperity nor profit, but rather a most certain da∣mage; they have conspired against me, and said among themselves, forsake not your gods, forsake not <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>oa, Igout, Joac,</HI> and <HI>Nesar,</HI> they erre from the right way; Lord,

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the name of God, gracious and merciful. Say to the people, I have received an inspiration, which some de∣vils heard of me when I read the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and that they said, we have heard the miraculous <HI>Alcoran</HI> read, it teach∣eth the right way; we believe in what it contains; we be∣lieve not that God hath companions; we believe there is but one God, we believe not that he hath wives, or chil∣dren, our ignorant persons blaspheme against his divine Majesty, nevertheless we imagin that they could not do it. There are who require aid of the devils, and augment their confusion, because they say, that God will not cause any to rise again; some devils have said, we have been as high as heaven, and found it furnished with guards and stars, we staied in a place a little distant to hear; there is one star that watcheth them that hearken, and drives them away; we know not if God hateth the men that are upon earth, or if he will teach them the right way; but we are now in the number of them that believe in the uni∣ty of his divine Majesty: they sayd, oh ye people! we were before in the way of error; we heretofore believed that God did not operate on earth, but no person, in whatsoever place he be, can avoid obeying his Will; we heard the book read that teacheth the right way;
<PB N="365" REF="195"/>
we believe in what it contains; he that believeth in God, will not fear any misery or injustice: there be of us that are good, and that trust in God; others there are, who are wicked and impious: such as obey the Commandements of God, follow the right way, and the wicked shall be precipitated into the fire of hell. Had the Infidels fol∣lowed the right way, we had sent them from heaven abun∣dance of rain, and given them our grace, I will try them, and such as shall despise the <HI>Alcoran</HI> shall be punished. The Temples belong to God, invoke one sole God in the Temples: when his servant riseth, he worshippeth his divine Majesty; it wanted not much, but these d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vils had published the plurality of Deities: Say unto the people, worship God my Lord; I believe in one God, who hath no companion, I can neither guide nor seduce you, but through his permission; If I d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sobey him, none shall be able to save me, and I shall want protection at the day of Judgement. I can do no more for you, then to preach to you his Law; this is the subject of my Embassie: He who shall disobey God and his Prophet, shall be damned, and shall remain eternally in the fire of hell. The wicked shal know such as shall be deprived of succour and protecti∣on, when they shall behold the pains prepared for them. Say unto them, I know not whether what is promised to you, shall incontinently happen, or whether God will de∣fer it some time; none knoweth what is to come but God, and those whom he hath elected to be Prophets and Mes∣sengers of his Will; he inspireth into them his Com∣mandments, to preach to men; he upholdeth all the acti∣ons of men, and keepeth an exact accompt of every thing.</P>

Remember thou the name of God, for∣sake the world to worship him, he is Lord of the West, and East, there is no god but God, take him for thy protector: be not impatient at what the wicked say; separate thy self from their society, without fear, leave me to punish them; is there any one that is able to defend them? their punish∣ment is deferred, but I have chains of iron, bread full of thorns, and great torments to inflict on them, at the day when the earth shall tremble, and the mountains shall be dissolved into dust.

We have mentioned this number of nineteen, to seduce the Infidels,

to fortune, or after the barbarous custome of the <HI>Arabi∣ans,</HI> sold him to the <HI>Ismalite</HI> Merchants, who expo∣sing him to sale in the Markets, he was purchased by <HI>Abdemonople,</HI> a wealthy Merchant; He after some observation, and experience of his wit and industry, withdrew him from the common drudgery of a slave, to employ him with his other factors in Commerce, and finding him apt for those affaires, gave him the conduct of his Camels into <HI>Syria, Aegypt, Persia,</HI> and else∣where. By which, in a short time, he became so expert in his Trade, that as be encreased the wealth and pro∣fit of his Master, so he gained his good will, and affe∣ction.</P>
<P>At that time <HI>Heraclius</HI> being Emperor of the East, and the seāmlesse coat of the Church torne by variety of Sects, and Heresies, the Bishops and Governors in <HI>Constantinople</HI> justly fearing divine vengeance, by reason of the <HI>Nestorian</HI> heresie, which with that of the <HI>Monothelites,</HI> began afresh to infect their Clergie, deliberated on some Ecclesiasticall censure against them: When <HI>Sergins</HI> a Monke, and Sectary of <HI>Nestorius,</HI> conscious of his error, and dreading the punishment, fled secretly into <HI>Arabia,</HI> and found re∣treat and entertainment with <HI>Abdemonople,</HI> the ma∣ster of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> where finding slender hopes of pro∣pagating his infectious Heresie (the family being Pa∣gans) and lesse of overthrowing his opposites in Reli∣gions, he resolved to take revenge on Christianity it self, and to that effect began to practise on <HI>Mahomet,</HI> as a Subject prepared to receive the impression of his de∣sign.</P>
<P>In the mean time, <HI>Abdemonople</HI> dyed, his riches being augmented through the care and industry of <HI>Ma∣homet,</HI> who having before insinuated into the favor of his Mistris <HI>Aijffa,</HI> by presents of rare toyes, procured in his Travels, by them, or through Sorcery (of which he was held guilty, and laboureth to purge himself in his <HI>Alcoran</HI>) so charmed her affection, that of her slave, he was advanced to be Lord both of her person, and fortunes.</P>
<P><PB N="397" REF="211"/>Being thus grown opulent, he sometime continued his trade, but then willing to take ease, as he had, during his voyages through severall Countries, been a See∣ker, and inquisitive concerning the diversity of Religi∣ons professed through the universe, so now (though irresolute which to follow) he rejected all, as vain, and foolish, except Judaisme and Christianity, and approving the latter as the best, accordingly framed his life, assuming a specious forme of San∣ctimony, which brod admiration in them that con∣sidered his former education, and gave him a repute above his expectation. But this hasty fruit was soon corrupted, and with the touch of Ambition (like the Ap∣ples of <HI>Sodom</HI>) soon vanished into stink and filthinesse.</P>
<P>For <HI>Sergius,</HI> as subtile, as malicious, observing his disposition, and withall, after some discourse con∣cerning the two Religions, of both which he found him excellently ignorant, seeing it no difficulty to distill into him the poyson of his Herefic, easily perswaded him, That Jesus Christ was but man simply; that for the merit of his vertues he was held as Deified: that the sufferings of his death were but humane inventions; that he was transported from this life to an immortall, and glorious, by another way then that of Death: That there is but one God, in one Person; so that the Faith of the Christians is vain, and invented; and that of the <HI>Jewes</HI> too loose and leane, through their owne obstinacy. That the <HI>Arabians</HI> being a dull and igno∣rant people, inclining neither to the one nor the other, but all (as many as had been touched with the fame of his new sanctity) admiring his perfections; The <HI>Jewes</HI> and <HI>Christians</HI> being likewise enemies to each o∣ther, and the <HI>Christians</HI> at variance among themselves; He might in that juncture of affairs, assume the title of a Prophet sent from God, to disabuse the one and the other, and save the world by another Law. This Counsell of <HI>Sergius</HI> took the desired effect, and <HI>Ma∣homets</HI> thoughts, before enflamed with his new gotten wealth, and fame, now entertained more ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> desires
<PB N="398" REF="212"/>
of being esteemed a Prophet, looking upon all other attri∣butes of Religion, and sanctity, as vile and abject.</P>
<P>To this effect, on a sudden he retires to a solitary Cave, not far distant from <HI>Mecca,</HI> while <HI>Sergius</HI> proclaimed the vain perfections of his life, and filled the ears of the people with the noise of his deservings. The terme of two years expired, <HI>Mahomet</HI> again appears to the world, and as if newly returned from Oracles of Heaven, stileth himself a Prophet sent from God, who willing through his mercy, to withdraw him from that precipice of his everlasting ruine, and admonish him of his error, afflicted his body with the falling-sicknesse, which <HI>Mahomet</HI> instead of repenting, made an ad∣vantage to promove his wicked design. For his wife lamenting to see her self yoaked to one so diseased, and tormented with an hideous infirmity, be excused it, and easily wrought in her a beliefe, that being constrained frequently to converse with the Angel <HI>Gabriel,</HI> his fraile body, unable to abide the splendor of his heavenly presence, fell into that distemper, and at the departure of the divine Ambassador, recovered its former conditi∣on. His wife believing this, was not wanting to divulge the rare qualities of her husband, his admirable sanctity, and frequent converse with the Angell, which gained him the esteem of a Prophet in his own house, and reve∣rence among his Neighbours.</P>
<P>That this Infant-repute of his Holinesse might be the better strengthened, <HI>Mahomet</HI> thought it requisite to promulgate some Chapters of his <HI>Alcoran</HI> (as a Re∣monstrance of his Commission) which as he saw occa∣sion, he shaped (though ill-favouredly) to his designes, giving out that he received them from the Angel <HI>Ga∣briel,</HI> as the Counsells and precepts of God, who for that he had not saved men, either by the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> the Psalmes of <HI>David,</HI> or the Gospell of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> did now promise them infallible Salvation by the means of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> which though rudely, yet cunningly con∣trived, as complying with the loose humour of the <HI>Arabi∣ans,</HI> enjoyning nothing strict or burthensome, but lea∣ving
<PB N="399" REF="212"/>
all to liberty; as the sole means to allure them to a belief of it, induced first the Parents and allies of his wife, then the more ignorant and meaner sort to embrace it, and esteeme <HI>Mahomet</HI> as the Messenger of God sent to guide them into eternall felicity, and the enjoyment of Paradise, which the easier to ensnare them, he fained to be full of such pleasures as fall under sense, and a plentifull fruition of those delights, that in those more barren and desert parts of <HI>Arabia</HI> they ex∣ceedingly wanted.</P>
<P>Having thus drawn to his devotion, a numerous, though vulgar party of the people, who in opinion of his Pro∣pheticall Function were prompt to his obedience; he thought it altogether as easie to obtain a Kingdome, as he had found it not difficult to attain to the title of a Prophet; and to effect this, having before, under pretence of Reformation of Religion, gained many followers, while more stood as lookers on, not at all regarding that De∣coy; he resolved to yoak to it that other concomitant in popular disturbances, liberty, proclaiming it to be the will of God, that all men should enjoy it, and that the Edict might be first obeyed in his own family, enfranchized his Slave, called <HI>Zeidi.</HI></P>
<P>This bait, as it inhaunced his fame, so it added to his retinue: for as multitudes, affecting novelty, and a mu∣tation of condition, daily added themselves to his party; so slaves from all parts of <HI>Arabia</HI> forsook their Masters, and fled to him as their Redeemer, and embraced his Law, as the means of their salvation. These through a fond conceit of his piety, ready to sacrifice their lives at his command, he divided into troops, and sent to rob the Ca∣ravans of Merchants that travelled through the de∣serts, and by this means, having added to his treasure by spoil; and his retinue daily encreasing by a multitude of Fugitives and Vagabonds, who by reason of his liber∣ty, to act any villany, resorted to him; he at length took up thoughts of imploying them in the confirmation of his Law, which he knew to be the ready way to his establish∣ment, in that power to which he aspired.</P>
<P><PB N="400" REF="213"/>To this purpose he marcheth with his Troops towards <HI>Medina</HI> (the place of his birth and buriall) to preach in a Synagogue of Jewes there inhabiting. These lesse stupid then the <HI>Arabians,</HI> could not indure his impostures, and instead of believing, did handsomely beat him, and drive his train from the town. This repulse rather irrita∣ting then terrifying him, he drew all his force into the field, and assailed the Jewes in two severall conflicts; in one of which, by a wound on the face with a sword, that broke out his fore-teeth: He signed the Articles of his Law with his blood, and continued a long time as dead in a ditch; but being rescued by his Slaves, and recovered of his wound, he again fought and vanquished them, and converted their Synagogue into a Temple, for his own use.</P>
<P>The fame of his exploits increasing, with the number of his Sectaries (to whom some Princes and eminent persons of the Countrey began to incline, giving him their daugh∣ters in marriage) awakened the <HI>Nobles</HI> of <HI>Mecca,</HI> parti∣cularly the family of <HI>Coreis,</HI> who wisely judging a new form of Religion, propagated by a new way, force of arms, must inevitably introduce a new Government, of which <HI>Mahomet,</HI> of base and obscure beginnings would be chief, as the Author, opposed themselves to his designs, expelled all such as seemed to favour him, out of the City, and severall times gave him battell; in which he so valiantly deported himself, that though he was som∣times put to the worst, yet he more often prevailed; and giving freedome to such prisoners as would imbrace his Law, encorporated them into his Army, strengthning himself, and weakning his enemies. Being in fine a com∣pleat Conqueror in the field, he assaulted the City of <HI>Mecca,</HI> took it, and after some slaughter of the Nobili∣ty, his enemies, proclaimed impunity to all that would acknowledge him a Prophet of God, by whose favour (as he affirmed) and appointment, not by his own valour, he had attained to that honor. After this Proclamation, many for fear of present danger, and apprehension of future bondage, more out of ignorance imbraced his beliefe, and he injoyed the vaine felicity, to see
<PB N="401" REF="213"/>
himself Generall of an Army, Lord of a vast Coun∣trey, and to be esteemed, and reverenced as a Pro∣phet.</P>
<P>About that time <HI>Heraclius</HI> the Emperor, disposing himselfe rather to improve the Heresie of the <HI>Mono∣thelites,</HI> then to defend the Confines of the Empire, not onely permitted <HI>Mahomet</HI> to domineere in <HI>Arabia,</HI> but gave advantage to <HI>Cosroes</HI> the <HI>Persian</HI> King, to invade his Dominions: but at length awakened by the alarmes of so puissant an enemy, levied a strong Army, and summoned the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Sarra</HI> signifies in their tongue a Desart, &amp; <HI>Sahen</HI> to inhabit.</NOTE> <HI>Saracens</HI> (a people so called from their inhabiting the Desart) to his assistance. The <HI>Per∣sian</HI> vanquished, and the <HI>Saracens</HI> expecting the salarie of their labours, and with some importunity demanding it, were answered, that the Emperor had not sufficient Treasure to pay the <HI>Christian</HI> Troops, and therefore those Heathen Dogs must attend the conveniency of their Prince. Incensed by this contempt, they retired,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ds</HI> his Tra∣vell.</NOTE> and marched by the way of <HI>Africk,</HI> where finding <HI>Maho∣met</HI> busie to inlarge his power; he aggravated their discontents, affirming it to be the Will of God, that all men should injoy their Liberty, that God was offended at their oppressions, and willed them to oppose the tyranny of the <HI>Christians,</HI> and that whosoever died in that holy war, his soul should be instantly transported to Paradise. These motives raised them to a resolution of making defection, so that they elected <HI>Mahomet</HI> their Generall, who incontinently deprived the Emperor <HI>Heraclius</HI> of his Tribute, and his Officers (who were slaine in demanding it) of their lives. After this act, the whole Province, which that of <HI>Egypt,</HI> revolted, and the people generally esteeming the successe of <HI>Ma∣homets</HI> armes (which he was diligent to imploy) as a sure testimony of the goodnesse of his Cause, embraced his Religion.</P>
<P><HI>Heraclius</HI> having neglected to strangle this rebellion, in its birth, indeavoured to extinguish it, being now growne to considerable strength; and to that end sent an Army under the Conduct of <HI>Theodesius</HI> his Favorite;
<PB N="402" REF="214"/>
his Army was twice overthrowne, the Generall slaine, and the <HI>Mahometans</HI> pursuing their victories, tooke from the <HI>Greeks</HI> the Countries of <HI>Egypt, Syria;</HI> and other Provinces of <HI>Africa,</HI> where <HI>Mahomet</HI> in∣creased his Triumphs, and erected his Trophies.</P>
<P>Being now growne impotent, rather through his inordinate life, then burthen of years, he retired full of glory, as a King and Prophet, to <HI>Mecca,</HI> where he re∣solved to end his dayes, having affirmed it in the <HI>Alco∣ran</HI> to be the most holy City of the world, as that wherein stood the Temple of <HI>Abraham,</HI> built miraculously by Angells, to be the Sanctuary of all that repaire thither in Pilgrimage. And therefore it was, that when he had by his Armies taken the City of <HI>Antioch,</HI> he durst not enter into it in person, lest by the delightfull and fer∣tile scituation of it, he should have been inticed to desert <HI>Mecca;</HI> and contradict his own Prophesie. His life now drawing to a period, a Plurisie surprized him; On the seventh day, for <HI>Crisis</HI> of his disease, he became fran∣tique. <HI>Haly,</HI> one of his successors, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stonisht at his di∣stemper and frenzie, not esteeming it one of the rare qua∣lities of a Prophet and Redeemer (as he stiled himself) of so much people, derided him, yet willing to continue his Law, that he might inherit his Power, carefully concealed it, and according to his commands (yet living) watched his body after his decease. For he told his followers, that he should rise again the third day, and ascend to heaven. They observed this, and guarding his Corps four daies intire, with impatient expectation of his Resurrection, were at length compelled by reason of its putrifaction, to take him up, ond bury him at <HI>Me∣dina,</HI> where his Reliques are annually visited by the su∣perstitious Pilgrims of his Religion.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Prophet of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and Au∣thor of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> died on the twelf day of the Month <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> <HI>Rabeg,</HI> in the great climatericall yeare of his Age, having abused men with his horrible impostures, full 23. years, dwelling in the esteem of a Prophet; ten at <HI>Mecca,</HI> and thirteen at <HI>Medina.</HI> His coming was

He was (as himselfe confessed) altogether illiterate, and though by nature subtile, and quick witted, yet often pusled for the in∣vention of delusive Miracles, to confirme the <HI>Arabians</HI> in their Belief. For he continually preached to them, that God had sent him to confirm his Law by force of Armes, and not by Miracles; yet the people instantly de∣manding them, as signs of his Mission, he was constrained first to tell them of a certain voyage to Heaven, which was briefly thus. The Angel <HI>Gabriel,</HI> with threescore and ten pair of wings, came to him by night, as he was in bed with his wife <HI>Aijssa,</HI> told him God had sent for him, he going down with this Angell, found at his door an Heterogeneous beast, called <HI>Elborach,</HI> halfe Asse, halfe Mule, but much swifter then either: (for it would go as far at one step as the most quick-sighted could see) this Beast, or believer of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> would not let <HI>Maho∣met</HI> mount him, unlesse he would first promise to pray for him, which the charitable Prophet did, and was in the twinkling of an eye brought by him to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> where the Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> tyed the Beast with his girdle to a rock, and taking <HI>Mahomet</HI> on his shoul∣ders, carried him to heaven-gate. They knocked, and the Porter understanding <HI>Mahomet</HI> to be there, instant∣ly opened, and bade him welcome; In this first Heaven he saw Angels, of divers and monstrous shapes; some composed of fire and snow, others of fire alone, every of them diversly shaped; among the rest, one with the head of a Cock, whose feet touched one Heaven, and head ano∣ther (each Heaven being distant from the other, a voyage

of five hundred years) and when he crowes (which is his language) he moves the Cocks of the earth to crow: This Angell recommended him to another, he to a third, and so one to another, until he came to the Heaven, where God kept his residence. God curteously received him, asked him how his people did, how they entertained his Law, and familiarly laid his hand upon his shoulder, which was so cold, that it pierced to the marrow of his back∣bone. God had soon done with him, only telling him how often his people should make their prayers, which were so many, that as he was returning, in the fourth Heaven, <HI>Moses</HI> advised him to go back to God, and entreat him that fewer prayers might serve his turne, for his people were not able to make so many; which he did, and after many returnes, brought the number to five. This done, he went back to his <HI>Elborach,</HI> which in a mo∣ment brought him to his house in <HI>Mecca,</HI> where he went to bed again to his wife, she not once dreaming her hus∣band would leave heaven for her company, or thinking he had been there; all this he performed in the tenth part of a night. The <HI>Turks</HI> at this day fondly believe this as a truth, but the <HI>Arabians</HI> of his time requiring him to do as much in their view, he (unwilling to take again so long a journey) replyed, Praised be God, I am man and an Apostle. He had other slights, which in sight of the people, by Art or Sorcery, he performed, and they stupidly believed, and entertained as miracles: as a Pigeon being by him taught to come and pick a pease out of his eare, he told them it was the holy Ghost that came to tell him what God would have him do; so an Oxe brought him a Chapter of the <HI>Alcoran</HI> upon his hornes, in a full assembly. He likewise perswaded them, that being at dinner at the house of one that pretended to be his friend (who had an intent to poison him, or he at least was so informed) a shoulder of mutton served in to the table, fore-warned him, that he should not eat of it; and though many were present, none but he heard or un∣derstood the language of the mutton, and yet he permitted one of his deerest friends to eat of it, and die impoisoned.
<PB N="405" REF="215"/>
Such, and many of the like nature were his miracles: As the bowing of trees, shaken by some sudden gust of wind: the howling of Wolves, and braying of Asses, which is their language, desiring <HI>Mahomet</HI> to pray for them; and he Prophetically understanding, as religi∣ously performed. His custome was often to inculcate into the ears of his Auditors, that God gave him com∣mission to fulfill his own desires in all things; and to that purpose introduceth God speaking to him. To thee O Prophet! It is permitted to lie with all women that are given thee, or thou dost purchase, thy Aunts and kin∣dred, and all good women that freely desire thy company, and this is lawfull for thee alone. His issue was one on∣ly Son, called <HI>Casfim,</HI> who died before him, and many daughters; <HI>Fatione</HI> the eldest (in high esteem at this day among the <HI>Arabians,</HI> and honoured as the royall root of <HI>Aben Alabecy</HI>) was wife to <HI>Haly. Zeineb</HI> the se∣cond was married to <HI>Osmen,</HI> after son to <HI>Mahuvias,</HI> and perhaps to both successively, for they both succeeded in the Empire of <HI>Arabia;</HI> to her is attributed the origi∣nall of the other family of <HI>Aben Humeia.

<P>GOod Reader, the great <HI>Arabian</HI> Imposter now at last after a thousand years, is by the way of <HI>France</HI> arrived in <HI>England,</HI> and his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> or <HI>Gallimaufry</HI> of Errors (a brat as deformed as the Parent, and as full of heresies as his scald-head was of scurffe) hath learned to speak <HI>En∣glish.</HI> I suppose this piece is exposed by the Translator to the publike view, no otherwise then some Mon∣ster brought out of <HI>Africa,</HI> for people to gaze, not to dote upon; and as the sight of a Monster, or mishapen creature should induce the beholder to praise God, who hath not made him such; so should the reading of this <HI>Alcoran</HI> excite us both to blesse Gods goodnesse towards us in this land, who injoy the glorious light of the Gos∣pell, and behold the truth in the beauty of holinesse; as also to admire Gods judgements, who suffers, so many Countreyes to be blinded and inslaved with this mishapen issue of <HI>Mahomets</HI> braine, being brought forth by the help of no other midwifry, then of a <HI>Jew</HI> and a <HI>Nesto∣rian,</HI> making use of a tame Pigeon (which he had taught to pick corn out of his ears, instead of the Holy Ghost, and causing silly people to believe that in his fal∣ling

<P>I know the publishing of the <HI>Alcoran</HI> may be to some dangerous and scandalous, dangerous to the reader, scan∣dalous to the higher powers, who notwithstanding have cleared themselves by disliking the publishing, and questi∣oning the publishers thereof; but for the danger, I will deliver in these ensuing propositions my opinion, yet with submission to wiser judgements.</P>
<P N="1">1. Though it may be dangerous to such as like reeds are shaken, and like empty clouds carried about with every wind of doctrin, yet to staid &amp; solid Christians, the reading of <HI>Mahomets</HI> Heresies wilbe no more dangerous, then the reading of those errors which are recorded in Scripture, for in them are mentioned many damnable errors and a∣bominations of the <HI>Egyptians, Cananites, Hittites, Si∣donians,</HI> and other <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and of the <HI>Hebrews</HI> them∣selves, of the <HI>Sadduces</HI> who denied Spirits, Angells, and the Resurrection.</P>
<P N="2">2. Is there more in reading the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> then in rea∣ing the Errors of ancient and modern Heretikes? surely <HI>Tertullian, Irenaus, Epiphanius, Austin,</HI> and other Fa∣thers were not of this opinion, who have left upon record to posterity, the damnable heresies of <HI>Arians, Eutychians, Nestorians, Macedonians,</HI> and others: and in the <HI>Alco∣ran</HI> there are not such dangerous errors as among the <HI>Tetratheites, Angelites,</HI> and <HI>Theodosians,</HI> who held there were four Gods, or the <HI>Tritheites,</HI> who affirmed there were three, or the <HI>Gnosticks, Manicheans, Cerdo∣nians, Marcionites,</HI> who maintained there were two con∣trary Gods, the one good, the other bad, whereas the <HI>Al∣coran</HI> sets down there is but one true God; and although it denieth with <HI>Arius,</HI> the Divinity of Christ, yet it holds him a great Prophet; nor doth it speak so blasphemously of Christ as the <HI>Simonians,</HI> who held <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> or the <HI>Ophites,</HI> and <HI>Manicheans,</HI> who said, the Serpent was Christ, or <HI>Menander,</HI> who affirmed himself to be Christ, and the Saviour of the world. Besides; are not the dam∣nable Heresies of the modern <HI>Familists,</HI> who deny Christs
<PB N="408" REF="217"/>
Divinity, making as many Christs, as there be illumina∣ted Elders in their Congregations? are not also the He∣resies of the <HI>Socinians, Antitrinitarians, Adamites, Ser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etians, Antisabbatarians,</HI> and many others exposed to the view of all that will read them? why then may not the <HI>Alcoran</HI>? Besides, are men debarred from reading the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latine</HI> Poets? nay, are not many of them translated into our English tongue? as also the modern Histories of the East and West <HI>Indies,</HI> wherein are more damnable tenets then any in the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and they who have read the <HI>Jewish Talmud,</HI> and <HI>Cabala,</HI> will find them as ridiculous pieces as the <HI>Alcoran.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. If there were any lovelinesse, beauty, excellency, or any thing else in the <HI>Alcoran</HI> that might win the mind, and draw the affection after it, I should hold the reading of it dangerous, but whereas it is such a mishapen and de∣formed piece, I think the reading of it will confirm us in the truth, and cause us love the Scripture so much the more: for as a beautifull body is never more lovely then when she is placed neer a Black-moore, neither is truth more amiable then when it is beset with Errors. <HI>Opposita juxta se posita clariùs elucescunt,</HI> the Gem receives lustre from the foile, the starrs from the night, and fire is most scorching in Frost, even so by an Antiperistasis truth is fortified by error. Who can think that the sight of a Hob-Goblin, or deformed vizard should draw the child from the Nurse or brest of the Mother to embrace it, whereas the sight thereof will rather cause the child hold faster by the mother. The wise <HI>Spartans</HI> oft-times brought drun∣kards into the room where their sons were, not that they should be induced thereby to love, but to abhorr drunk∣kenness, which they could not have done, had they not seen the unseemly and rude carriage, the undecent behaviour, and uncomposed gestures of the drunkard. When <HI>Zisca</HI> had destroyed the <HI>Adamits</HI> of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> he preserved two alive that they might reveal to the world the wicked er∣rors of that Sect: Who is so mad as to prefer the embrace∣ments of a filthy Baboon, to his beautifull Mistresse, or the braying of an Asse to a consort of Musick? he deserves
<PB REF="217"/>
the ears of <HI>Midas</HI> that will prefer the Cuckoes song to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>weet notes of the Nightingale.</P>
<P N="4">4. Though the <HI>Alcoran</HI> be received among many Na∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions, yet this reception proceeds not from any love they bear to it, or any lovelinesse they find in it, but partly out of fear, being forced by the Sword, partly out of a prepo∣sterous desire of liberty and preferment, and partly out of ignorance, as not being suffered to read the Scriptures, nor to hear Philosophy, by which the errors thereof may be detected, nor to enquire into the absurdities thereof, or to dispute and question any thing in it: for which cause also it is not suffered to be Printed, nor are Christians permitted to enter into <HI>Mecca,</HI> least their absurdities and impieties of their Religion should be manifested: and thus are those silly souls kept in blindnesse and ignorance, and therefore I never read that any Nation did volunta∣rily receive the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> except the theevish <HI>Saracens</HI> of <HI>Arabia,</HI> because it was a friend both to their theevery and lechery, as permitting multiplicity of Wives and Concu∣bines, and a reward for those that shall murther and rob.</P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>Alcoran</HI> is translated into <HI>French</HI> and other vulgar Tongues, and the chief heads thereof by <HI>Pur∣chas</HI> in his <HI>Pilgrimage,</HI> by <HI>Heilin</HI> in his <HI>Geography,</HI> &amp; by others into our own tongue without scruple or exception; and I pray you, why is the <HI>Arabick</HI> tongue, the language of that false Prophet, and in which he writ his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> so much learned and taught in Schools and Christian Universities, but that by it we may come to the know∣ledge of <HI>Mahomets</HI> La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Religion? and how should we know this little ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n in <HI>Daniel,</HI> that spake high and proud things against the Almighty, if we read not his life and doctrine?</P>
<P N="6">6. There is a kind of necessity we should know evill as well as good, falshood as well as truth, that we may a∣void the one, and so much more love the other; he that hath smelled a stinking weed will smell with more delight the sweet Rose, he that reads the <HI>Alcoran</HI> will find it smell worse then <HI>Mahomets</HI> carkasse did, which after his death lay putrifying upon the ground, which his disciples
<PB REF="218"/>
permitted for many daies together, hoping he would have been as good as his word, who made them a promise that he would rise again the third day; but at last finding he had forgot himself, and that his body smelling not so sweet as <HI>Alexanders</HI> did after his death, they were for∣ced to bury it, or otherwaies the dogs who were beginning to bury him in their guts had saved them a labour, though Sugar be sweet in it self, yet it is much more sweet to him, that hath tasted <HI>Aloes</HI>; and though <HI>Italy</HI> in it self be a delicious Countrey, and garden of the world, yet it is much more delightfull, pleasant, and beautifull, to him who hath passed over the mountanous, craggy, and rugged Alps: Did not the Prodigall love the bread of his fathers house evermore the better after he had been fed on husks with swine? doubtlesse we shall find, that after we have fed a while upon the course husks of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> with the <HI>Arabian</HI> swine, we shall with much more eagernesse covet after the plenty of our Fathers house, exhibited to us in his Word, where we shall find the hidden Manna, the bread of Life, that came down from heaven.</P>
<P N="7">7. Books of Palmistry, Phisiognomy, judiciall Astrolo∣gy, Necromancy; and other superstitious and impious Arts have been permitted to come abroad, that men might see the vanity of those Arts, the knavery and wickednesse of the Artists, the foolishnesse of credulous people, who suffer themselves to be deluded by them, and the malice of Satan the arch-enemy of mankind, whose delight is to a∣buse, delude, and destroy men: why then may not the <HI>Alcoran</HI> be read, that men may see the vanity, impiety, and foolishnesse of it, by which the world hath been so ma∣ny yeare cheated and abused?</P>
<P N="8">8. They that learn Arts and Sciences, desire the knowledge, not only of the good things, but of the evill things also, and the abuse of them, to the end they may avoid them; there Logick speaks as well of sophisticall and fallacious syllogismes, as of demonstrative and topi∣call; Ethicks treats of vices as well as of vertues; Naturall Philosophy handleth the natures▪ not only of usefull and
<PB REF="218"/>
beneficiall creatures, but also of hurtfull and venomous, as of Serpents; Physick speaks of poysons as well as of cures; Historians describe both the vertuous and vicious actions of Princes; in Divinity we learn, not only what God and good Angells are, but also what Sathan is, and his wicked Angells; in Navigation we must know, not only what places are Navigable, but also what are not▪ how shall we avoid Rocks, Quick-sands and Shelves if we know them not? even so Christian Religion permits not only the reading of Scripture, but also of hereticall and heathenish books, as is said, that we may know what to embrace, what to shun; therefore if you would know what be the damnable errors to be avoided by Christians, read the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and you shall find in it the sink of all, or most part of ancient heresies.</P>
<P N="9">9. In reading of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> though it be, as <HI>Cato</HI> said of the three <HI>Romane</HI> Embassadors, that were to go to <HI>Antiochus,</HI> headlesse, heartlesse, and footlesse, the one being maimed in his head, the second a fool, and the third lame in his feet, I say, though it be without head or tail, as we use to speak, being immethodicall and confu∣sed, contradictory in many things, written in a rude Language, the Author himself being no Linguist or Scholler; nay, not able to read or write, though also it consist of lies and senselesse follies, yet this benefit we may reap; I say, in reading of it, that we shall be forced to admire and praise the goodnesse of God towards us Chri∣stians, who having suffered a great part of the world to sit in the valley of the shadow of death, to be oppressed with Cim∣merian, yea more then palpable <HI>Egyptian</HI> darknesse, hath placed us in the Temple, where we have the golden Can∣dlestick of his Word, and a clearer and more durable Lamp then that of <HI>Salomons</HI> Temple, yea even the Sun of righteousnesse shining upon us in the Land of <HI>Goshen,</HI> whilst a great part of the world doth follow the Antichri∣stian beast, we follow the Lamb upon mount Sion; while they hear the voice of Satyres, Ostrages, and Schrich Owls, we hear the voice of the Turtle, and the Songs of Sion in our own Land: whilst they feed on husks with
<PB REF="219"/>
swine, &amp; drink the corrupted puddles of <HI>Mahomets</HI> in∣ventions, we are fed with Angels food, and eat coelestiall Manna, and drinke of the pure river of life, cleare as Crystall: Againe, we may tremble at the reading of this <HI>Alcoran,</HI> when we consider the severity of Gods judgements, and the fiercenesse of his anger, who for the contempt of his Gospell, in those Countreyes where <HI>Mahomet</HI> is worshipped, hath suffered so many millions of people to be deluded, blinded, abused, and inslaved by that false Prophet, to believe his lies; and by loathing the sweet Evangelicall Manna, to de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oure greedily the poisonable guailes of his doctrine, and with it the wrath of God, which hath falne on them, whilst the flesh is between their teeth, so that they must needs perish everlastingly. Who would have thought that those Countreyes which were honoured by Gods owne presence, by the Oracles of the Prophets, by the presence, miracles and preaching of Christ, by the planting of the Apostles, by the blood of so many Martyrs, should be thus besotted, and inslaved by the tyranny of this grand Impostor?

The <HI>Turks</HI> are our neighbours, and their territo∣ries border upon the Dominions of Christendome: there have been continuall warres, and will be still be∣tween us; it concerneth every Christian who makes con∣science of his waies, to examine the cause, and to look in∣to the grounds of this war, whether they be just or not, which cannot be known but by reading the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> in which we see the <HI>Mahometans</HI> to be the enemies of the Crosse of Christ, in denying his Death, and of his Divi∣nity also,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Euseb. in vit.

<P N="13"><PB REF="220"/>13. We cannot do better service to our Countrey-men, nor offer a greater affront to the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> then to bring out to the open view of all, the blind <HI>Sampsons</HI> of their <HI>Alcoran,</HI> which hath mastered so many Nations, that we may laugh at it, of which even their own wise men are ashamed, and are sorry it should be translated into any other language; for they are unwilling that their grand Hypocrite should be unmasked, or that the vizard of his pretended holinesse should be taken off, whose fil∣thy nakednesse must appear when he is devested: they know that words and works of darknesse cannot endure the light, <HI>Trepidánt{que} immisso lumine manes,</HI> the infer∣nall Ghosts tremble at any glimpse of light, and the wild beasts returne to their dens, saith <HI>David,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal. 10.4.</HI> Ʋt jugu∣lent homi∣nes sur∣gunt de nocte la∣trones.</NOTE> when the morning appeares, not daring to seek their prey, but in the dark night of ignorance; this great thief <HI>Maho∣met</HI> hath destroyed many thousand, and under the Li¦ons skin, this Asse hath affrighted his beastly minded Saracens, therefore let us take away the ring from this <HI>Giges,</HI> by which he hath made himselfe invisible, and let us with <HI>Hercules</HI> pull out this theeving <HI>Cacus</HI> out of his darke den where he useth to hide and shelter himselfe, and expose his deformed carkasse to the pub∣like view, that we may wonder at it: and in dete∣cting his Errours, wee follow the practise of CHIST, who discovered to the world the damnable Tenets of the Scribes, Pharisees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 13.</NOTE> Hy∣pocrites.</P>
<P N="14">14. The <HI>Turks</HI> are preposterously zealous in pray∣ing for the conversion, or perversion rather, of Christians to their irreligious Religion, they pray heartily, and every day in their Temples, that Christi∣ans may imbrace the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and become their Proselytes, in effecting of which they leave no means unassaied by feare and flattery, by punish∣ments and rewards: Now, is it fitting that they in charity and zeale should exceed us? wee are bound to pray and endeavour heartily for their
<PB REF="221"/>
conversion, from darknesse to light, from error to truth; but how shall we do this, if we know not the dangerous and damnable estate they are in, which we cannot know but by reading their <HI>Alcoran?</HI></P>
<P N="15">15. In reading the <HI>Alcoran</HI> we shall see what is the force of superstition, and with what violence men are carried head-long in the defence and main∣tenance even of the most absurd and impious opini∣ons; what <HI>Hecuba</HI> is more deformed then the <HI>Al∣coran</HI>? yet how do the Turks fight and struggle, toil and care, hazard life and liberty, estates and all for it, as if it were the most beautifull <HI>Helena</HI> in the world? these men cannot endure the Image of Christ, or of a Saint in their Temples, calling this Idolatry, and yet they are the greatest Idolaters in the world them∣selves, for never was there such an Idol as the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> no man must touch it, till first he be washed, and that being done, he must not touch it with his naked hands, but with a clean linnen cloth; the Priest must kisse it, and bow to it; he must when he reads in it hold it up on high, for it is a sin to hold it lower then his girdle: Every piece of paper that a <HI>Turk</HI> findes he must use reverendly, because the <HI>Alcoran</HI> is written in paper, the Mule that carries it to <HI>Mecca</HI> is held in great veneration, so that he or she is sanctified all the year after that can but touch him, and that handkerchief which wi∣peth off his sweat is a holy relique: thus do they strain at a gnat and swallow a Camell.</P>

In reading the <HI>Alcoran</HI> and <HI>Turkish</HI> Story, we shall see who were <HI>Gog,</HI> and <HI>Magog,</HI> that made warre a∣gainst the Saints, even the <HI>Turks</HI> an obscure people of <HI>Scythia,</HI> therefore called <HI>Gog,</HI> because they were hid and unknown a long time, and the <HI>Saracens</HI> who were a known people, and the open enemies of the Church, therefore called <HI>Magog</HI>; these treacherously combined together, oppressed first the Persians, and afterward the <HI>Greek</HI> Empire, with the famous Churches of

<HI>Asia, Greece,</HI> and <HI>Egypt:</HI> we shall also find that by the Star which fell from heaven, and opened the bottomlesse pit, whose smoke darkned the Sun, and out of which came the Locusts, whose terror is described by St. <HI>John,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. 9.</NOTE> is meant <HI>Mahomet</HI> that great destroyer, as his name signifi∣eth, answering to the name <HI>Appollyon,</HI> and <HI>Abaddon</HI>: for never was there such a destroy∣er, who by his pestilent doctrine hath destroyed so many soules, and by the sword of his Locusts hath destroyed so many bodies, and ruinated so many goodly Countries.</P>
<P N="17">17. If you will take a brief view of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> you shall find it a hodg-podge made up of these four ingre∣dients. 1. Of Contradictions. 2. Of Blasphemic. 3. Of ridiculous Fables. 4. Of Lyes. First, of Con∣tradictions, he doth ordinarily say, and unsay the same thing; one while he tells us, that he was the first that ever entred into Paradise, and elsewhere he saies he found men and women there; sometimes he affirmes that <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Christians</HI> shall be saved by their own Religion, and sometimes again that none can be saved who embrace not his <HI>Alcoran</HI>; In one place fol∣lowing the Opinion of <HI>Origen,</HI> or rather of the <HI>Origenists,</HI> he affirmed that all the devills shall be saved; in another place he saith, only those devills shall be sa∣ved who hearken to, and obey his <HI>Alcoran.</HI> Secondly, of Blasphemy, for he blasphemeth God, in saying that he prayeth for <HI>Mahomet,</HI> intimating hereby that he is inferiour to that God he prayeth to; he makes God also swear by Flies, Wormes, and such base creatures, as if he were their inferiour, whereas God ha∣ving none greater then himself, swears only by himself; He blasphemes the Father, in saying he cannot have a Son, because he is not married, as if there were no other generation but what is carnall; he b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asphemes the Son with <HI>Arius,</HI> in denying his Divinity; he blasphemes the Holy Ghost with <HI>Macedonius,</HI> affirming him to be the Creature of a creature; he blasphemes God also, in
<PB REF="222"/>
making him the Author of his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> bragging that his name is written upon the Throne of God, in that he is the greatest of the Prophets, who hath more knowledge then all the men and Angels of the world: and many o∣ther bragging words he uttereth of himself, by which we may see he is that little horn which sprung up among the ten horns of the great and terrible beast of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, destroying three of the <HI>Roman</HI> horns, to wit, the <HI>Asians, Grecians,</HI> and <HI>Egyptians</HI>; this is the horn that hath many eyes, as being crafty and vigilant, but his mouth speaks proud things, in blaspheming and bragging, as we have heard. Thirdly, of ridiculous Stories, and which are more unsavory then the <HI>Golden Legend,</HI> or <HI>Lucians</HI> true Narrations; he tells us that he divided once the Moon, one half whereof fell into his lap, (this was not then the Man in the Moon, but the Moon in the Man) the other on the ground; these two pleces he fouldred a∣gain. Perhaps in memory of this lying miracle, the <HI>Turks</HI> use it the half Moon for their Armes: He tells us of a great army of men and Angels raised by <HI>Salomon,</HI> but much hindred in their march by an army of Flies, which <HI>Salomon</HI> rebuked, where we have a witlesse conference be∣tween <HI>Salomon</HI> and the fly; he tells you a strange story of <HI>Noahs</HI> Ark, how there the Hog was generated of the Elephants dung, and a Rat of the Hogs dung, which gnawing a hole in the Ark, at which <HI>Noah</HI> was affrigh∣ted; he touching the Lion on the forehead, out of whose brains leaped out a Cat, (as <HI>Minerva</HI> did out of <HI>Jupiters</HI>) which caused the Rat to run away: this is Philosophy in∣deed for a Hog. Fourthly, of Lies, for he belieth God, in making him author of his impiety and heresies; he belies Christ, in saying he was conceived by the smell of a Rose; he belyeth the Holy Ghost, in affirming that he inspired <HI>Mahomet</HI> to write the <HI>Alcoran</HI>; he belyeth the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> calling her the daughter of <HI>Amram,</HI> and sister of <HI>Moses,</HI> confounding her with <HI>Mi∣riam,</HI> whereas there were so many generations between; he belyeth the Gospel, in saying it is corrupted by Chri∣stians; he belyeth Christians, when he saith they wor∣ship
<PB REF="222"/>
many gods, and that they give to God a companion, when they acknowledg the Divinity of Christ; he bely∣eth the <HI>Jewes,</HI> in saying they make <HI>Elcazar</HI> a god; he belies the Patriarchs, in saying that <HI>Noah, Abraham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> believed his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> being so many thousand yeers before he was born, or his <HI>Alcoran</HI> had a∣ny existence: he belies also the Apostles, in making them his Schollers, who lived neer six hundred yeers before he was born. By all which we may see, who was the Com∣piler of this <HI>Alcoran</HI>; not the God of Truth, but the Father of Lies; not Christ and his Apostles, whose weapons in propagating the Gospel, were powerfull preaching, miracles, and patience in suffering; not the sword, the chief means that <HI>Mahomet</HI> useth to force his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> an instrument forbid by Christ, but used by him who hath beene a murtherer from the beginning. But I will not take upon me the task of refuting the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> being already refuted by <HI>Cantacu∣zenus, Richardus</HI> the Monk, <HI>Cusa</HI> the Cardinall, <HI>Wood∣manstadius, Savanorolla,</HI> and others. I only thought good, upon intreaty of some learned and religious men, to annex this brief Caveat, that the Reader might be the better armed to encounter with any rub or difficulty be shall meet with in the reading thereof. But before I end, give me leave to cleare my self again in this point; that it is not my meaning all should have the liberty to read the <HI>Alcoran</HI> promiscuously. I know with the Apostle, that though all things be lawful, yet all things are not ex∣pedient; there are children as well as men in understan∣ding: the nurse may use that knife which the child may not; and that sword which may without danger be hand∣led by a sober man, cannot without danger be touched by a mad man: There are as well queasie as strong sto∣macks, and what is meat to the one, may be venome to the other. Though <HI>Mithridates</HI> could without hurt eat poyson, others may not presume to escape so; it is law∣full for any to look upon a monster, but it is not expedi∣dient for conceiving women; that iron which an Estrich can digest, may destroy the stomack of other creatures:

how many have been deceived in gathering Hemlock for Parfly? It is not for every man to meddle with Apothe∣caries drug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, he may chance meet with poison as seen as an antidote▪ if all men were like Bees, to suck honey out of Henbane, there might be no danger in reading of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> but most men are like Spiders, suck securely poison even out of the sweetest Roses; therefore they only may surely and without danger read the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> who are intelligent, judicious, learned, and throughly grounded in piety, and principles of Christianity; but weak, ignorant, inconstant, and disaffected minds to the truth, must not venture to meddle with this unhallowed piece, lest they be polluted with the touch thereof, as they were who came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eer to a leprous body; and if we will not venture to go into an infected house without preser∣vatives, much lesse should any dare to read the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> that is not sufficiently armed with grace, strength, and knowledge against all temtations. God grant we may walk in the light of the Gospel whilst we have in, that we may not be overwhelmed with the dismall night of <HI>Ma∣hometane</HI> darknesse, which God may justly i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tict upon us; for our sins, rents and divisions are no lesser then those were of the <HI>Greek,</HI> and <HI>Asiatick</HI> Churches, and doubt∣lesse except we repent we shall all perish with them, who for despising Gods sacred Oracles, are now taught to reverence every piece of paper they find, which they are made believe shall be put under the soles of their fee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when they walk over the burning grate to their fools Pa∣radise, as <HI>Busbequius</HI> in his Epistle tells us, who lived long amongst them, and was well acquainted with their opinions; but what I have written here concerning the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> I submit to the judgment and wisdom of those who sit at the Stern, and can see more then the Passen∣gers.</P>

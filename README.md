# Ethical Consumption Before Capitalism Data+ Year 3

We combine close and distant reading techniques to evaluate the metaphorical and ethical language surrounding three major English trading companies from 1580 to 1640. These are the English East India, Levant, and Virginia companies. More than just the exchange of goods, we explore the early modern documentation of how these companies facilitated cultural, religious, political, and economic affairs both peacefully and violently, as well as how authors used various arguments to justify England's colonial aspirations abroad. 

## We build upon the work of previous Duke University Data+ and Bass Connections projects:

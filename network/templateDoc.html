    <h3>N-Gram Generation and Categorization</h3>

    <text> The tobacco n-grams in this network are created from Gensim's bigram and trigram models. Some 'trigrams' have four words because we have deliberately ignored connecting words like 'of' when counting the value of 'n'. Scroll to the <b>Text Information</b> section for the original contexts around the n-grams in each text. Edges are colored based on what words occur in the tobacco n-grams: </text>

    <h3>K-Means Clustering</h3>
    <text>
        Each unique text is vectorized with a set of weighted features: the body text, topic words from Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling (multipled by 50), keywords metadata from the Library of Congress  (multipled by 50), tobacco n-grams  (multipled by 10), instances of tobacco or drug in the body text  (multipled by 20), and key terms within the body texts (multipled by 20). These features are vectorized using Scikit-Learn's TF-IDF vectorizer and clustered with the k-means algorithm. Then, the clusters are labeled based on the <b>top 20 TFIDF terms</b>, <b>10 keywords metadata</b> from the Library of Congress, and <b> 20 topic words</b>. Scroll to the <b>Text Information</b> section for details about authorship, titles, and dates for each text.

Remove these tags:

    <header> or <temphead> (contains <availability>, <idno>, <language>, etc.)
        or just remove everything outside of <eebo>
    everything outside of <ets> (the tag for text), which will just be ref links
          or outside of <eebo>
    <date> (after obtaining pub dates)
          but also may be part of header and thus deleted together
    <bibno> and <altbibno>
    <idg>, <stc>
    <vid>
    <keywords>
    <milestone> (usually pg or ln numbers)
    <lb>, <pb>
    removing comments? tag might be <!>
    <text lang>

interesting tags:
    <ref>, <note> (because it could be notes from EEBO 400 years later or notes from the author, such as definitions, but also need to remove "note place"), <gap> (for illegible characters)
